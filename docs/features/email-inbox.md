## Future Integration with Cloudflare Email Worker

The frontend is prepared for integration with your Cloudflare email worker:

### API Integration Points
1. **Email Fetching**: `handleRefresh()` function ready for API calls
2. **Send Email**: `ComposeModal.onSend()` prepared for worker integration
3. **Email Actions**: Archive, delete, star actions ready for backend sync
4. **Real-time Updates**: Structure supports WebSocket integration

### Expected API Endpoints
```javascript
// Suggested API structure for Cloudflare Worker
GET /api/emails?folder=inbox&limit=50
POST /api/emails/send
PATCH /api/emails/:id (for actions like star, archive)
DELETE /api/emails/:id
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations Implemented
- **Lazy loading**: Email list supports pagination
- **Memoization**: Components use React.memo where appropriate
