## 📋 How It Works

### For Assigned Contacts
```
Contact "John Doe" assigned to Agent Sarah
    ↓
John calls your workspace
    ↓
ONLY Sarah's phone rings
    ↓
Sarah answers → Call connected
```

### For Unknown Callers
```
Unknown number calls workspace
    ↓
ALL agents' phones ring
    ↓
First agent to answer gets the call
```

### Concurrent Calls
```
Time 10:00 → Customer A calls → Agent 1 answers
Time 10:02 → Customer B calls → Agent 2 answers  
Time 10:05 → Customer C calls → Agent 3 answers

✅ All 3 calls active at the same time!
```
