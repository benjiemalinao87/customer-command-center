# Livechat Phone Selector Removal

## Overview
Removed the phone selector component from livechat version 1 as it was redundant since the `/send-sms` endpoint automatically determines the appropriate phone number to use for outgoing messages.

## Background
The `/send-sms` endpoint implementation (in `backend/index.js`) has built-in logic to:
1. First check if the contact has a `board_phone_number` in their metadata
2. If found, use that specific phone number (after verifying it belongs to the workspace)
3. If not found, fall back to using the first available workspace phone number

This automatic phone number selection made the manual phone selector in the UI redundant.

## Changes Made

### Files Modified
1. **`frontend/src/components/livechat/ChatArea.js`**
   - Removed `PhoneNumberSelector` import
   - Removed `selectedNumber` and `phoneNumberError` state variables
   - Removed `handlePhoneNumberSelect` function
   - Updated `handleSend` function to not require phone number selection
   - Updated test functions to not require selected phone number
   - Removed phone selector UI element from chat header

2. **`frontend/src/services/messageStore.js`**
   - Made `selectedNumber` parameter optional in `sendMessage` function
   - Updated function to only include 'from' field in API request if explicitly provided
   - Added fallback values for optimistic message creation

### Files Removed
1. **`frontend/src/components/livechat/PhoneNumberSelector.js`** - Deleted entirely as no longer needed

## Technical Details

### How Phone Number Selection Works Now
- **Frontend**: No longer requires phone number selection
- **Backend**: `/send-sms` endpoint automatically determines phone number using this logic:
  ```
  1. Check contact.metadata.board_phone_number
  2. If found and valid → use it
  3. If not found → use first workspace phone number
  ```

### Sample Contact with Board Phone Number
Contact ID: `c9bea7f1-88ab-46eb-8083-c3af170f61d4` (referenced in request)
The system supports contacts with `metadata.board_phone_number` for specific phone number routing.

## Benefits
1. **Simplified UX**: Users no longer need to manually select phone numbers
2. **Reduced Errors**: Eliminates possibility of sending from wrong number
3. **Automatic Routing**: Contacts with board-specific phone numbers automatically use the correct number
4. **Fallback Support**: Graceful fallback to workspace default if no specific number assigned

## Backward Compatibility
- The `sendMessage` function still accepts an optional `selectedNumber` parameter for other parts of the application that may still pass it
- The backend `/send-sms` endpoint still accepts a `from` field but it's optional

## Testing
The removal maintains all existing functionality while simplifying the user experience. The backend logic ensures messages are sent from the most appropriate phone number automatically.
