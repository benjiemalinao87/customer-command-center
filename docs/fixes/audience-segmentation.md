# Audience Segmentation Email Filtering Fix

## Issue
Email filtering in the audience segmentation feature was not working correctly. Despite having contacts with matching emails in the database, the audience count and contact list returned zero results when filtering by email.

## Root Cause
1. Case sensitivity issues with email comparison in Supabase queries
2. Standard Supabase filtering methods (`.ilike()` and `.filter()`) were not properly handling case-insensitive email matching
3. The JavaScript SDK's handling of string comparisons differed from direct SQL queries

## Solution
1. Created a custom SQL function in Supabase to handle case-insensitive email matching:
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION find_contact_by_email(email_param TEXT, workspace_id_param TEXT)
   RETURNS SETOF contacts
   LANGUAGE sql
   SECURITY DEFINER
   AS $$
     SELECT * 
     FROM contacts 
     WHERE 
       LOWER(email) = LOWER(email_param) 
       AND workspace_id = workspace_id_param;
   $$;
   ```

2. Modified the BroadcastService.js to use different approaches for different filter types:
   - For email filters with "equals" operator: Use the RPC function approach
   - For all other fields and operators: Use standard Supabase query methods

3. Implemented a fallback mechanism in case the RPC function fails:
   ```javascript
   if (emailError) {
     console.error('Error using RPC function for email filter:', emailError);
     // Fallback to regular filtering if RPC fails
     return query.ilike('email', emailFilter.value.trim());
   }
   ```

## Key Learnings
1. **Database-Side vs. Client-Side Filtering**:
   - When dealing with case-insensitive string operations, database-side functions (SQL) are more reliable than client-side filtering
   - Using custom SQL functions (via RPC) can provide more precise control over filtering logic

2. **Supabase Query Methods**:
   - Different Supabase query methods (`.eq()`, `.ilike()`, `.filter()`) may behave differently for the same data
   - For case-insensitive operations, SQL's `LOWER()` function is more reliable than JavaScript's `.toLowerCase()`

3. **Testing Strategies**:
   - Direct SQL queries should be used to verify data existence before debugging application code
   - Creating test scripts that compare different query methods helps identify discrepancies

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Implementing fallback mechanisms ensures the application continues to work even if preferred methods fail
   - Proper error logging helps identify issues in production

## Future Improvements
1. Create similar RPC functions for other common filtering operations that require special handling
2. Add comprehensive test cases for all filter types and operators
3. Consider adding database indexes to improve performance of case-insensitive queries
4. Implement client-side validation to ensure filter values are properly formatted before sending to the server
