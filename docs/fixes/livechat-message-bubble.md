# LiveChat2 Message Bubble Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Message Status "Sending..." Bug
**Problem**: Messages were showing "Sending..." status even after they were successfully sent and received.

**Root Cause**: 
- Temporary messages were created with `status: 'sending'`
- When the server response came back, the message replacement logic wasn't properly prioritizing the server's status
- The `isTemp` detection logic was working correctly, but messages with real IDs were still showing as sending

**Solution**:
- **MessageBubble.js**: Updated status detection logic to only show "sending" for temporary messages that are actually being sent:
  ```javascript
  const messageStatus = isTemp && message.status === 'sending' ? 'sending' : (message.status || 'delivered');
  ```
- **LiveChat2.js**: Fixed message replacement logic to prioritize server status over client status:
  ```javascript
  const updatedMessage = { 
    ...data, // Server data takes precedence
    ...messageData, // Preserve client-side data like attachments
    id: data.id, // Use server ID, not temp ID
    status: data.status || 'sent', // Prioritize server status
    // ... other fields
  };
  ```

### 2. Timestamp Position Outside Message Bubble
**Problem**: Timestamps were displayed inside the message bubble footer, cluttering the message content.

**Solution**: 
- Moved timestamps outside the message bubble for cleaner visual separation
- Created a separate flex container below each message bubble to display:
  - Timestamp (always visible)
  - User/agent information (for outbound messages)
- Updated both email and standard message rendering to follow the same pattern

**Visual Changes**:
- **Before**: Timestamp was cramped inside the bubble footer with status indicators
- **After**: Clean timestamp display outside the bubble with proper spacing and alignment

## Files Modified

1. **frontend/src/components/livechat2/MessageBubble.js**
   - Fixed status detection logic
   - Moved timestamps outside message bubbles
   - Simplified internal footer to only show critical status information

2. **frontend/src/components/livechat2/LiveChat2.js**
   - Improved message replacement logic in `handleSendMessage`
   - Ensured server status takes precedence over client status

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: No more confusing "Sending..." status on delivered messages
2. **Cleaner Design**: Timestamps outside bubbles follow modern messaging app patterns
3. **Improved Reliability**: Proper status management prevents UI inconsistencies
4. **Mac OS Design Philosophy**: Follows clean, minimal design principles

## Testing Notes

- Test message sending in different scenarios (SMS, email, comments)
- Verify temporary messages show "Sending..." only while actually sending
- Confirm timestamps appear outside bubbles with proper alignment
- Check that status indicators (AI, errors) still work correctly inside bubbles
