# Performance Optimization Strategy

This documentation outlines our phased approach to optimizing the application's performance. Each phase focuses on specific aspects of the application, with detailed implementation guides, examples, and testing procedures.

## Overview

Our performance optimization strategy is divided into seven phases, each addressing different aspects of application performance:

1. [Logging and Debug Cleanup](./phase1_logging_cleanup.md)
2. [Supabase Query Optimization](./phase2_query_optimization.md)
3. [React Component Optimization](./phase3_component_optimization.md)
4. [State Management and Caching](./phase4_state_caching.md)
5. [Code Splitting and Lazy Loading](./phase5_code_splitting.md)
6. [UI Rendering Optimization](./phase6_ui_optimization.md)
7. [Database and Infrastructure Optimization](./phase7_database_optimization.md)

## Implementation Approach

For each optimization phase:

1. **Analyze**: Identify specific performance bottlenecks
2. **Plan**: Document the optimization strategy
3. **Implement**: Make targeted changes
4. **Test**: Measure performance improvements
5. **Document**: Update this documentation with results and lessons learned

## Performance Metrics

We track the following metrics to measure improvements:

- Page load time
- Time to interactive
- Component render time
- Database query execution time
- Network request latency
- Memory usage
- CPU utilization

## Tools

- React Profiler
- Chrome DevTools Performance tab
- Lighthouse
- Supabase query performance monitoring

## Getting Started

Begin with [Phase 1: Logging and Debug Cleanup](./phase1_logging_cleanup.md), which provides immediate performance benefits with minimal risk.
