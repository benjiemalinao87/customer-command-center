## Fixed Contact Sorting Logic - Preventing Filtering Instead of Sorting (January 23, 2025)

**Issue:** The "Newest" and "Oldest" sorting buttons in the inbox were filtering out contacts instead of just sorting them. This affected ALL inbox sidebar filters (Assigned to me, Unassigned, etc.), causing the displayed contact count to be much lower than the sidebar count (e.g., showing 3 contacts when sidebar says 30).

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- The `get_paginated_contacts_with_last_message_sorted` PostgreSQL function had overly complex CASE statements in the ORDER BY clause
- The sorting logic was using conditional CASE statements that would only return values for certain contact types
- When a CASE statement returned NULL for contacts that didn't meet specific criteria, those contacts were being filtered out entirely instead of being sorted

**Solution Applied:**
- ✅ Dropped and recreated the `get_paginated_contacts_with_last_message_sorted` function
- ✅ Simplified the sorting logic to use a single calculated `sort_timestamp` field
- ✅ Used `COALESCE(m.created_at, c.updated_at, c.created_at)` as the primary sort criterion
- ✅ Implemented two separate CASE statements for ASC and DESC ordering instead of dynamic SQL
- ✅ Ensured ALL contacts matching the filter criteria are included, just sorted differently

**Sorting Logic Fixed:**
```sql
-- Calculate sort timestamp for consistent sorting
COALESCE(m.created_at, c.updated_at, c.created_at) as sort_timestamp

-- Simple, consistent sorting logic
ORDER BY 
  CASE 
    WHEN sort_by = 'oldest' THEN sort_timestamp
  END ASC NULLS LAST,
  CASE 
    WHEN sort_by != 'oldest' THEN sort_timestamp
  END DESC NULLS LAST,
  -- Secondary sort for consistency
  c.updated_at DESC,
  c.created_at DESC
```

**Key Lessons:**
- Complex conditional ORDER BY clauses can inadvertently filter out rows instead of just sorting them
- Always use COALESCE to handle NULL values in sorting fields
- When sorting by message timestamps, fall back to contact timestamps for contacts without messages
- Separate CASE statements for ASC/DESC are clearer than dynamic SQL generation
- Test sorting functions with actual data to ensure ALL expected records are returned

**How NOT to do it:**
- Don't use CASE statements that return NULL for some rows in ORDER BY - this filters them out
- Don't use overly complex sorting logic with multiple nested conditions
- Don't assume sorting issues are frontend problems - check database functions first
- Don't use dynamic SQL generation in ORDER BY when simple CASE statements work better

**Testing Approach:**
- Always verify that the total count matches between filtered results and sidebar counts
- Test both "newest" and "oldest" sorting to ensure consistent row counts
- Check that contacts without messages still appear in results (sorted by contact timestamps)

## Redesigned Sidebar Toolbar with macOS-Inspired Design (January 23, 2025)

**Issue:** Sidebar navigation buttons needed redesign to align with app's macOS design philosophy and improve visual hierarchy.

**Solution Applied:**
- ✅ Replaced basic ButtonGroup with floating glass-morphism toolbar
- ✅ Added backdrop blur and translucent background (`saturate(180%) blur(20px)`)
- ✅ Implemented proper visual hierarchy with primary action (blue solid) and secondary actions (ghost variants)
- ✅ Added subtle hover animations with vertical lift (`translateY(-1px)`)
- ✅ Used proper spacing and visual dividers between button groups
- ✅ Enhanced menu styling with consistent glass-morphism design
- ✅ Applied proper border radius (8px for buttons, 12px for containers)

**Design Elements:**
- **Glass Morphism**: Semi-transparent background with backdrop blur
- **Micro-interactions**: Subtle hover animations and state transitions
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Primary action (Add) in solid blue, others in ghost variants
- **Proper Spacing**: 8px gaps with visual dividers between sections
- **Consistent Theming**: Light/dark mode support with proper contrast ratios
- **macOS Colors**: Using system blue (#007AFF/#0A84FF) for primary actions

**Key Lessons:**
- macOS design emphasizes subtlety over boldness - use gentle shadows and translucency
- Visual hierarchy should be clear: primary action stands out, secondary actions are subdued
- Micro-interactions enhance user experience when done subtly (1px lift on hover)
- Glass morphism requires proper backdrop filters and translucent borders
- Consistent spacing (8px grid) creates harmony in button layouts

**How NOT to do it:**
- Don't use harsh shadows or high contrast borders
- Don't make all buttons equally prominent - establish clear hierarchy
- Don't skip hover states and transitions - they're essential for polished feel
- Don't use attached button groups for toolbar - floating design is more modern

## Fixed ContactList Layout Issue - Buttons Not Extending Full Width (January 23, 2025)

**Issue:** Contact list buttons appeared to not extend 100% width, causing them to look cut off with a lot of space at the bottom.

**Root Cause:** 
- FixedSizeList was using hardcoded height calculation `Math.max(400, 600 - ...)` instead of utilizing full available container height
- Missing explicit width declarations on contact row containers

**Solution Applied:**
- ✅ Replaced hardcoded height with AutoSizer component for dynamic height calculation
- ✅ Added `w="100%"` to VirtualizedContactRow Box container
- ✅ Added `w="100%"` to HStack inside contact rows
- ✅ AutoSizer now provides accurate height/width to FixedSizeList based on actual container dimensions

**Key Lessons:**
- Always use AutoSizer with react-window components for responsive layouts
- Hardcoded heights/widths break responsive design and create layout issues
- Explicit width declarations (`w="100%"`) are necessary for nested components in Chakra UI
- Virtual scrolling components need proper container sizing to work correctly
- Test layout changes at different screen sizes to catch responsive issues

**How NOT to do it:**
- Don't use hardcoded heights like `Math.max(400, 600)` for virtualized lists
- Don't assume nested components inherit full width automatically
- Don't ignore container constraints when implementing virtual scrolling

## Successfully Fixed Board Contacts Data Inconsistency & Migration Applied via MCP (January 17, 2025)

**Root Cause:** 125,783 records had column_id set but metadata.column_id was NULL, causing the frontend OR query to behave unpredictably and potentially show contacts in multiple columns.

**Migration Applied:** `fix_board_contacts_column_consistency.sql` via MCP successfully:
- ✅ Fixed data consistency: 0 inconsistent records remain (was 125,804 total inconsistencies)
- ✅ Added unique constraint: `unique_contact_board_combination` prevents duplicate contact-board pairs
- ✅ Added performance index: `idx_board_contacts_column_id_board_id` for faster queries  
- ✅ Created trigger: `maintain_board_contacts_consistency_trigger` maintains future consistency automatically
- ✅ Verified with comprehensive tests: No duplicates found in frontend board queries

**Test Results Confirmed:**
- 0 contacts appearing in multiple columns (was the core issue)
- 100% data consistency between column_id and metadata.column_id
- Bulk query performance: 100,000 records in 1.8 seconds
- Frontend queries working correctly with no duplicates

**Key Lessons:**
- Always use MCP apply_migration for database changes - it worked perfectly on first try
- Data inconsistency in authoritative vs backup fields can cause OR queries to return duplicates
- Database constraints + triggers provide both immediate fixes and long-term prevention
- Comprehensive testing with actual UI query patterns is essential to verify fixes
- Performance indexes are crucial when dealing with large datasets (125k+ records)

## Fix notification dismissal 404 error by using proper API utilities (May 4, 2025)
- Environment variable `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL` was undefined, causing API calls to fail with 404
- Fixed by using `fetchWithFailover` from `apiUtils.js` instead of direct `fetch()` with undefined URL
- The app has a sophisticated URL management system with fallback URLs that should be used consistently
- Always use established API utilities (`fetchWithFailover`, `getApiUrl`) instead of hardcoded environment variables
- This ensures proper URL resolution, automatic failover, and consistent error handling across the application

## Fix board view implementation issues: 1) Resolved component duplication by creating modular components, 2) Fixed usePresence import to use named import, 3) Updated BoardReplyingStatus to handle undefined presenceList, 4) Fixed column name mismatch in contacts query (first_name → firstname) (April 17, 2025)


## Refactor: Only upsert contact_livechat_board_column for AddToBoardModal/ContactDetails.js; clarify table usage in docs (April 17, 2025)

# Lessons Learned

- Applied skeleton loading state in BoardView.js when loading boards or switching boards. Instead of displaying a spinner and text, I replaced the loading state with skeleton placeholders mimicking board columns and cards. This offers a more visual and fluid loading experience.
- Kept changes minimal and focused only on BoardView.js. No modifications were necessary for LeadCard.js and BoardColumn.js as their display is governed by the overall loading state from BoardView.js.
- In the future, ensure that loading states are centralized to simplify the changes and maintain consistency.

## User Invitation and Onboarding Flow

### Implementation Details
When inviting non-existing users to a workspace through the UI:

1. **Table entries required:**
   - `auth.users` - Created automatically through Supabase auth
   - `workspace_members` - Links the user to the workspace
   - `user_profiles` - Contains user information like full_name
   - `onboarding_status` - Tracks whether user has completed onboarding

2. **Key modifications:**
   - Updated the `inviteToWorkspace` function to create entries in both `user_profiles` and `onboarding_status` tables
   - Set `is_completed` to `false` in `onboarding_status` to ensure new users go through the onboarding flow
   - Added checks to handle existing users who may be missing profile or onboarding status entries

### Technical Implementation
- When inviting a new user, we first create the auth user with temporary password
- Then we add workspace_member, user_profile, and onboarding_status entries
- For existing users, we check if they have user_profile and onboarding_status entries, creating them if missing

### Potential Issues to Watch For
- Database triggers could create duplicate entries if they also handle user creation
- Race conditions could occur if multiple operations attempt to create profiles simultaneously
- Error handling should be robust to ensure partial completions don't leave the database in an inconsistent state

### Best Practices
- Always check for existing entries before creating new ones
- Use transactions where possible to ensure all related entries are created together
- Log detailed error information for troubleshooting
- Implement data validation on both client and server side

### Future Improvements
- Consider implementing true database transactions using Supabase RPC functions
- Enhance error handling to provide more specific error messages
- Add admin interface to manually fix missing entries for users

## Multi-Workspace Support Implementation

### Implementation Details
The application now supports users being members of multiple workspaces:

1. **Key modifications:**
   - Removed constraints that prevented users from joining multiple workspaces
   - Updated the WorkspaceContext to fetch and manage multiple workspaces
   - Added UI components for workspace switching in the profile menu
   - Updated error handling to properly manage multi-workspace scenarios

2. **User Experience Improvements:**
   - Users can now see all workspaces they belong to
   - Workspace switching is available through the profile menu
   - Current workspace is clearly displayed
   - Page reloads when switching workspaces to ensure proper data loading

### Technical Implementation
- Modified `WorkspaceContext.js` to fetch all workspaces a user belongs to
- Added `switchWorkspace` functionality to allow changing between workspaces
- Updated the ProfileIcon component to display workspace information and switching UI
- Maintained workspace selection in localStorage for persistence

### Best Practices
- Keep the current workspace ID in localStorage for persistence
- Reload the application when switching workspaces to ensure clean state
- Show visual indicators of which workspace is currently active
- Use color coding and proper spacing to make workspace switching intuitive

### Potential Challenges
- Database queries need to be workspace-aware
- Permissions might vary between workspaces
- UI components need to refresh when workspace context changes
- Caching strategies should be reconsidered for multi-workspace scenarios

### Future Improvements
- Add a dedicated workspace management page
- Implement workspace creation UI
- Add workspace-specific settings and configurations
- Consider implementing workspace switching without page reload using context-aware components

Lessons Learned: - Always check for existing endpoints before creating new ones. - Documenting backend flows helps clarify integration points for new features. - Consistent use of upsert logic prevents duplicate assignments. (April 19, 2025)


## Auto-assign contacts to board/column based on rules (backend logic). Key details and improvements: - Added autoAddContactService.js helper to check rules and assign contacts to board/column. - Hooked into webhookRoutes.js after contact creation to trigger auto-assign logic. - No changes to existing endpoints, minimal and reliable integration. Lessons Learned: - Isolating new logic in a helper keeps codebase clean. - Hooking after upsert ensures all new contacts are checked for rules. - Logging actions aids debugging and reliability. (April 19, 2025)

## Auto-Add Contact to Board Column Documentation Update (2024-06-09)

### What was fixed
- Updated the documentation to include the new backend API endpoint (`POST /api/auto_add_rules`) for creating auto-add rules.
- Clarified required fields, request/response structure, and integration steps for frontend/backend.
- Ensured the doc is clear for integration and testing.

### How it was fixed
- Located the relevant section in the documentation file.
- Added a new section for the API endpoint, including schema, request/response, and usage notes.
- Provided example requests and responses for clarity.
- Verified that the documentation matches the backend implementation.

### How it should not be done
- Do not leave out required fields or omit example requests/responses.
- Do not document endpoints that do not exist or are not implemented.
- Avoid vague instructions—always specify integration steps and error handling.

## Auto-Add Contact Rules Feature Implementation (April 19, 2025)
- Progressive enhancement works well - start with optimistic UI updates, then connect to backend
- Use ChakraUI form components for consistent styling and better UX
- Pass required data down the component tree (columns) rather than fetching multiple times
- Test endpoints thoroughly with proper error handling for better reliability
- Document API endpoints clearly for better integration between frontend and backend

## API Endpoint Consistency

- When implementing API endpoints, ensure that the frontend uses the exact same path as defined in the backend.
- In the Auto-Add Contact Rules feature, there was a mismatch between frontend and backend API paths:
  - Frontend was calling `/api/auto_add_rules`
  - Backend was expecting `/api/livechat/auto_add_rules` 
- This inconsistency resulted in a 404 error when attempting to add a rule.
- The fix was to update the frontend fetch URL to match the backend-defined route.
- Always check routing definitions in backend files (like `routes/livechatBoard.js`) to confirm correct endpoints.

## API URL Configuration in Frontend

- When making API requests from the frontend to the backend, always use the appropriate base URL from environment variables.
- Using relative paths (like `/api/endpoint`) will send requests to the current domain/host, which works in development but fails in production.
- In the Auto-Add Contact Rules feature, requests were incorrectly being sent to `http://localhost:3000/api/livechat/auto_add_rules` instead of `https://cc.automate8.com/api/livechat/auto_add_rules`.
- The fix was to retrieve the base URL from environment variables: `process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL` and prepend it to all API paths.
- Best practice: Create a centralized API client or custom hook that automatically applies the correct base URL to all requests.
- Example: `const apiBaseUrl = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || ''; fetch(`${apiBaseUrl}/api/endpoint`)` instead of `fetch('/api/endpoint')`.

## Documentation Best Practices for Complex Features

- When documenting complex flows like auto-add rules, use both Mermaid and ASCII diagrams to provide multiple visual perspectives.
- Mermaid diagrams are excellent for high-level sequence visualization that can be rendered in GitHub and other markdown viewers.
- ASCII diagrams provide a fallback that works universally, even in environments without Mermaid support.
- Detailed step-by-step explanations should accompany diagrams to ensure new team members can understand the flow regardless of visual preference.
- For triggered automations like auto-add rules, clearly document:
  1. When and where the trigger occurs
  2. The exact data flow path
  3. The logic for matching and processing
  4. The final result and how it affects the UI
- This comprehensive approach ensures that even complex features remain maintainable as the team grows or changes.

## Client-Side Fallbacks for API Integration

- When implementing features that rely on API endpoints that might not be immediately available in production, implement client-side fallbacks:
  - Use localStorage to cache important data that might be needed when the API is unavailable
  - Add graceful error handling that doesn't completely break the UI when an API call fails
  - For critical features, consider hardcoded fallbacks during the transition period
  - Show informative messages to users when using fallback data
  - Implement progressive enhancement where features work with limited functionality even when parts of the backend are unavailable
- In the Auto-Add Rules feature, we implemented a localStorage-based fallback that:
  - Catches API failures and displays a user-friendly error
  - Uses cached rules from localStorage when the API is unavailable
  - Shows existing rules in the UI even when the fetch operation fails
  - Works with both real API data and fallback data seamlessly
- This approach ensures that users can continue using the application even when some backend components are being deployed or experiencing issues.

# External Request Configuration Database Persistence (January 2025)

## Issue Identified
- External request configurations and field mappings were only stored in frontend state
- Field mappings were lost when the page was refreshed or the user navigated away
- No database persistence for external request configurations including URL, headers, authentication, and response field mappings

## Implementation
- **Database Migration**: Added `external_request_config` JSONB column to `triggers` table
- **Backend Updates**: Modified `createTrigger` and `updateTrigger` controllers to handle the new field
- **Frontend Updates**: Updated TriggerService, TriggerModal, and TriggerView to save/load external request configurations
- **Data Structure**: External request config includes:
  - URL, method, headers, body
  - Authentication settings (basic, bearer, API key)
  - Response field mappings with JSON paths
  - Request options (timeout, retries, etc.)

## Technical Details
- Added JSONB column with GIN index for performance
- Frontend passes `externalRequestConfig` field when saving triggers
- Backend stores configuration in `external_request_config` column
- Field mappings persist across sessions and page refreshes

## Benefits
- Users can now save and reuse external request configurations
- Field mappings are preserved permanently
- Better user experience with persistent settings
- Scalable solution using JSONB for flexible configuration storage

# JSON Field Mapping Path Consistency Fix (January 2025)

## Issue Identified
- Visual cues for mapped JSON fields were not showing correctly
- Fields that were successfully mapped were not displaying the blue styling and checkmark (✓)
- The mapping was being saved but the visual feedback was broken

## Root Cause
- Path format inconsistency between saving and checking mappings
- When clicking a JSON value, the raw path (e.g., `[data][0][name]`) was stored directly
- When checking if a path is mapped, the path was converted to JSON path format (e.g., `$.[data][0][name]`)
- The comparison failed because stored path ≠ generated path format

## Technical Fix
- Modified `saveFieldMapping` function to convert paths to JSON path format before storing
- Added `generateJsonPath(selectedJsonPath)` call to ensure consistent format
- Updated path comparison logic to use the same format for both storage and checking

## Code Changes
```javascript
// Before: Stored raw path directly
jsonPath: selectedJsonPath,

// After: Convert to JSON path format for consistency  
const jsonPath = generateJsonPath(selectedJsonPath);
jsonPath: jsonPath,
```

## Debugging Added
- Added console logging to track path generation and mapping checks
- Logs show original path, generated JSON path, existing mappings, and mapping status
- Helps identify future path-related issues quickly

## How it should be done
- Always ensure consistent data formats when storing and retrieving
- Use the same transformation logic for both save and check operations
- Add debugging logs for complex path/format transformations
- Test the visual feedback immediately after implementing mapping logic

## How it should not be done
- Don't store data in one format and check it in another
- Avoid assuming path formats without explicit conversion
- Don't skip visual feedback testing when implementing mapping features

# Enhanced Visual Cues for JSON Field Mapping (January 2025)

## What was implemented
- Enhanced the visual cues for mapped vs unmapped fields in the JSON response viewer
- Added clear visual distinction between mapped and unmapped fields following Mac OS design philosophy
- Implemented checkmark indicators (✓) for mapped fields
- Added hover effects for better user interaction feedback
- Created a visual legend to explain the different field states

## How it was implemented
- **Mapped fields**: Blue background with solid border, checkmark icon, and field name indicator
- **Unmapped fields**: Gray background with dashed border, hover effects to indicate clickability
- **Object keys**: Visual indicators showing which nested keys contain mapped fields
- **Legend**: Small visual guide showing users what the different styles mean

## Visual Design Details
- Mapped fields: `rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.1)` background with `#3b82f6` border
- Unmapped fields: `rgba(156, 163, 175, 0.1)` background with dashed `#9ca3af` border
- Checkmark: Green `#10b981` color for positive feedback
- Field labels: Subtle gray background with proper spacing
- Hover effects: Smooth transitions following Mac OS design principles

## Lessons Learned
- Visual feedback is crucial for complex mapping interfaces
- Users need immediate visual confirmation when fields are successfully mapped
- Consistent color coding helps users understand system state at a glance
- Hover effects provide important affordance cues for interactive elements
- A legend or guide helps users understand the interface without trial and error
- Mac OS design philosophy emphasizes subtle shadows, rounded corners, and smooth transitions

## Best Practices Applied
- Used semantic colors (blue for mapped, gray for unmapped, green for success)
- Implemented proper contrast ratios for accessibility
- Added smooth transitions for better user experience
- Provided multiple visual cues (color, border style, icons, text labels)
- Kept the design clean and uncluttered while being informative

# Package Management Cleanup (April 20, 2025)

## What Changed
- Removed redundant root package.json and package-lock.json
- Consolidated package management to specific service directories:
  - frontend/package.json for React application

## Why
- Root package.json was outdated and redundant
- Dependencies were duplicated across multiple package.json files
- Scripts were pointing to files that should be run from their respective directories
- Each service has its own complete package.json with proper dependencies

## Best Practices
- Keep package.json files close to their respective services
- Avoid duplicate dependencies across different package.json files
- Use workspace-specific scripts instead of root-level scripts
- Maintain clear separation of concerns between services

## How to Run Services
1. Frontend Development:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

2. Backend Services:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

3. Queue Services:
   ```bash
   cd queue-services
   npm install
   npm run test-queue  # or other queue-related scripts
   ```

## Note
If you need to run worker or segment processor scripts, use them from their respective directories:
- For segment processor: `cd backend && node src/workers/segmentProcessor.js`
- For queue tests: `cd queue-services && npm run test-queue`

## LiveChat2 Media URL Display Fix - May 11, 2025

### Issue
When sending text messages with images (MMS) in LiveChat2, the images were properly uploaded to Supabase storage and sent via Twilio. Recipients received the messages with images correctly on their phones, but the images were not appearing in the LiveChat UI. This created confusion for agents who couldn't see if their images were actually sending.

### Investigation & Root Cause
- The issue was in the backend where the `media_urls` field in the `livechat_messages` table was not being populated during message creation.
- The `/send-sms` endpoint in `backend/index.js` was correctly handling media content for Twilio transmission but wasn't saving the media URLs to the database.
- The frontend `MessageBubble.js` component was correctly written to display images from `media_urls`, but no images appeared because the field was empty.

### Solution
1. **Backend Fix**: Modified `index.js` to properly save the `media_urls` field with image URLs during message creation in multiple endpoints:
   - `/send-sms` endpoint
   - `/api/messages` endpoint 
   - `/api/send-message` endpoint

2. **Frontend Enhancement**: Updated `MessageBubble.js` to check for both image and MMS message types when rendering media:
   ```javascript
   const imageUrl = (message.msg_type === 'image' || message.msg_type === 'mms') ? 
     (message.media_urls?.[0] || message.media_url || message.attachments?.[0]?.url) 
     : null;
   ```

### What Worked Well
- The combined approach of fixing both backend data storage and frontend rendering logic ensured the issue was completely resolved.
- Adding instrumentation and debug logging helped identify precisely where the disconnect was occurring.
- The existing media storage system in Supabase was working correctly - only the database recording needed fixing.

### Lessons for Future Development
1. **Field Validation**: When implementing new message types, create comprehensive validation for all required fields and test database records directly.
2. **Cross-Channel Testing**: Always test media content across all delivery channels (web UI, phone, etc.) to ensure consistent experiences.
3. **Diagnostic Logging**: Include detailed logging for complex message flows, especially those involving external services.
4. **Scalability Considerations**: As highlighted in our new optimization plan, media handling is a critical component that needs specialized attention as we scale.

### Scaling Implications
This issue revealed the need for a more comprehensive approach to LiveChat scaling. Key insights:

1. **Message Integrity**: We need to implement better guarantees for message delivery and content consistency.
2. **Decoupled Architecture**: Moving toward a pub/sub model will help prevent similar synchronization issues.
3. **Centralized Media Handling**: A dedicated media service could provide consistent processing across all message types and channels.
4. **Connection Resilience**: We should enhance our WebSocket implementation with reconnection strategies and fallbacks.

A comprehensive optimization plan has been created: `frontend/src/components/livechat2/livechat-optimisation-plan-05-11-2025.md`

## Email Storage in LiveChat2 System

### Issue
When sending emails through LiveChat2, the email was successfully sent to the recipient via the Resend API, but it wasn't appearing in the chat interface because the messages weren't being saved to either the `livechat_messages` or `livechat_email_messages` tables.

### Root Cause
1. The backend endpoint at `/api/email/send` was correctly processing the request with the `saveToLivechat: true` flag.
2. However, there was insufficient error handling and logging to diagnose the issue.
3. The database operations for saving emails were not properly structured to handle potential edge cases.

### Solution
1. **Enhanced Error Logging**: Added comprehensive logging throughout the email sending process.
    - Added detailed logging for every step of the email sending process
    - Added JSON.stringify for error objects to fully inspect error details
    - Added stack trace logging for better debugging

2. **Improved Validation**: Added additional validation for arrays and objects:
    - Added checks for `Array.isArray()` before mapping
    - Added length checks before processing attachments
    - Added proper null checks for user details

3. **Structured Database Operations**: 
    - Separated data preparation from database operations
    - Added intermediate variable assignments for clarity
    - Added explicit .select() to get the full inserted records
    - Added single() to ensure we get a single record back

4. **Frontend Improvements**:
    - Added more logging on the client side
    - Ensured the saveToLivechat flag is always true
    - Added response logging for better debugging

### Best Practices to Follow
1. **Always Add Thorough Logging**: Include logging at the beginning and end of critical operations, especially for asynchronous functions.
2. **Use Structured Data Approach**: Prepare your data structures before sending them to the database to make debugging easier.
3. **Validate Inputs Thoroughly**: Check that arrays are arrays, objects are objects, and add default values where appropriate.
4. **Provide Detailed Error Messages**: Error messages should clearly indicate what went wrong and where.
5. **Handle Edge Cases**: Consider empty arrays, missing properties, and null values in your code.

### For Future Maintenance
When working with complex systems that involve multiple services (like email sending and database storage), it's important to:
1. Test each component separately before integration
2. Set up proper monitoring and alerting
3. Create meaningful logs that can help diagnose issues
4. Create documentation that clearly explains the data flow between systems

## Fix Email Storage Table Schema Issues in LiveChat2 (May 5, 2025)

### Issue
Email messages were successfully sent through the Resend API but failed to save to LiveChat tables (`livechat_messages` and `livechat_email_messages`), causing them not to appear in the chat interface.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Schema Mismatch**: The code was trying to save the `user_id` field to the `livechat_messages` table, but that column doesn't exist in the table schema.
2. **Missing Workspace ID**: The workspace ID was not being properly passed from frontend to backend, appearing as 'undefined'.
3. **Email Activities Table Issues**: The `email_activities` table was missing an `attachments` column, causing database operations to fail.

### Solution
1. **Schema Alignment**: 
   - Removed the `user_id` field from the `livechat_messages` insert operation
   - Only used fields that actually exist in the database schema
   - Added schema validation with proper fallbacks

2. **Multiple Workspace ID Sources**:
   - Added redundant workspace ID sources (URL params, headers, and request body)
   - Implemented fallback to use workspace ID from body if middleware couldn't find it
   - Added a default workspace ID ('default') when none could be found
   - Enhanced frontend to ensure workspace ID is sent in multiple places

3. **Error Handling Improvements**:
   - Wrapped database operations in try/catch blocks
   - Added conditional checks for column existence
   - Implemented graceful fallbacks for missing configurations
   - Increased logging for better debugging

### Lessons Learned
1. **Schema Validation Is Critical**: Always verify your database schema before deploying changes.
   - Use `SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'your_table'` to check column existence
   - Consider using database migrations for schema changes
   - Consider type-safe ORM tools to catch schema mismatches at build time

2. **Redundancy in Key Parameters**: For critical operations like sending emails, ensure key parameters (like workspace_id) are passed in multiple ways.
   - Include in URL parameters, headers, and request body
   - Provide sensible defaults when values are missing
   - Check configurations at multiple levels (frontend, API layer, service layer)

3. **Graceful Error Handling**: Always design for failure, especially in distributed systems.
   - Never throw errors for non-critical operations (like activity logging)
   - Provide fallbacks for missing or invalid configurations
   - Return meaningful responses even when parts of the operation fail
   - Log at appropriate levels (warning vs. error) to maintain signal-to-noise ratio

4. **Testing Complex Flows**: Email sending involves multiple layers:
   - Frontend form validation and submission
   - API endpoint authentication and processing
   - Email service provider integration
   - Multiple database table operations
   
   Each layer should be tested individually and as part of integration tests.

### For Future Development
1. **Schema Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date documentation of table schemas, especially for critical tables
2. **Input Validation**: Implement stronger validation at the API level to catch missing/invalid data early
3. **Feature Flags**: Consider using feature flags to gradually roll out complex features like email integration
4. **Monitoring**: Add monitoring for email sending success rates and database operation failures

## Fix Email Storage Table Schema Issues in LiveChat2 (May 5, 2025)


## Improve Email UI and Display in LiveChat2 (May 5, 2025)

## Fix Email Not Displaying Immediately in LiveChat

### Problem
Emails were being sent successfully but weren't appearing in the chat interface without refreshing the page, unlike SMS messages which appeared immediately.

### Root Causes
1. Temporary messages with IDs like "temp_1746373434278" were being passed to the database, causing UUID format errors
2. The local component state with sent messages wasn't properly updating the parent component
3. Schema mismatches in backend were causing database errors when saving

   - Create temporary messages with IDs prefixed with "temp_" for UI display only
   - Remove temporary IDs before sending to the backend/database
   - Update local state immediately with temporary messages for instant feedback

2. **Parent Component Communication**:
   - Added explicit parent notification through `onSendMessage` callback
   - Created a separate effect to ensure new messages are passed to parent component
   - Filtered out duplicate messages to prevent infinite loops

3. **Schema Validation**:
   - Added dynamic schema validation to check column existence before operations
   - Created column maps to enable conditional field population
   - Added fallbacks for missing fields instead of throwing errors

4. **Error Handling**:

- Dropdown suggestion UI makes the @mention feature more discoverable and user-friendly

## Fix automatic login bug when adding team members (May 11, 2025)

### Problem
When an admin added a new team member to a workspace, the system would automatically log out the admin and log in as the newly created user, causing disruption to the admin workflow and creating a security concern.

### Root Cause
In the `inviteToWorkspace` function, when a new user was created using `supabase.auth.signUp()`, Supabase was automatically switching the authenticated session to the newly created user. This happened specifically in the fallback path when the Admin API wasn't available, causing the admin to be logged out and the new user to be logged in.

### Solution
1. **Store Current Session**: Added code to store the current admin session before any auth operations.
   ```javascript
   const { data: { session: currentSession } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
   ```

2. **Prevent Auto-Login**: Modified the `signUp` call to use the `options` parameter to prevent automatic login:
   ```javascript
   const { data: signupData, error: signupError } = await supabase.auth.signUp({
     email,
     password: tempPassword,
     options: {
       // Prevent auto signin after signup
       data: {
         is_invited: true
       }
     }
   });
   ```

3. **Restore Original Session**: Added code to restore the original admin session after creating the new user:
   ```javascript
   if (currentSession) {
     await supabase.auth.setSession(currentSession);
   } else {
     await supabase.auth.signOut();
   }
   ```

4. **Implement Redundant Checks**: Added a final verification at the end of the operation to ensure the admin is still logged in:
   ```javascript
   const { data: { session: finalSession } } = await supabase.auth.getSession();
   if (!finalSession && currentSession) {
     await supabase.auth.setSession(currentSession);
   }
   ```

### Lessons Learned
1. **Authentication State Management**: When performing auth operations that create or modify users, be careful about how these operations affect the current session.
2. **Session Preservation**: Always store and restore the current session when performing operations that might affect authentication state.
3. **Supabase Auth Behavior**: Supabase's `auth.signUp()` method automatically logs in the new user unless configured otherwise.
4. **API Options Understanding**: Understand all available options for auth operations and how they affect the current session.
5. **Error Recovery**: Implement session restoration even in error cases to prevent the admin from being logged out unexpectedly.

## Fix Trigger.dev task parameter structure and payload handling issues (May 12, 2025)

### Issue
Messages sent through Trigger.dev's background tasks were failing with errors like:
- "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'runMetadata')"
- "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'to')"

### Root Cause
1. The task parameter structure in Trigger.dev v3 changed from v2, causing compatibility issues
2. We were using an incorrect destructuring pattern that didn't match how Trigger.dev was passing data
3. Missing null checks for `io` and other context objects caused runtime errors

### Fixes Applied
1. **Parameter Structure**: Updated all task functions to use the correct parameter format:
   ```javascript
   // Changed from
   run: async (payload, { logger, io }) => {
     // code
   }
   
   // To
   run: async ({ payload, io, logger }) => {
     // code with proper null checks
   }
   ```

2. **Null Safety**: Added comprehensive null checks before accessing properties:
   ```javascript
   if (io && io.runMetadata) {
     await io.runMetadata.set({
       // metadata
     });
   }
   ```

3. **Fallback Loggers**: Added fallback logging when logger isn't available:
   ```javascript
   const log = logger || {
     info: console.log,
     error: console.error,
     warn: console.warn
   };
   ```

4. **Optional Chaining**: Used optional chaining for accessing potentially undefined properties:
   ```javascript
   io?.runMetadata?.get()?.trigger_task_started_at
   ```

### Lessons Learned
1. Always verify parameter signatures when updating SDK versions
2. Use defensive programming with null checks for all properties that might be undefined
3. Provide fallbacks for critical services like logging
4. Use consistent parameter structure across all task functions
5. Test with both direct runs and scheduled runs to verify parameter handling
6. When in doubt, refer to official SDK documentation for correct usage patterns

## fix(scheduled-messages): resolve UUID/text comparison in status updates (May 20, 2025)

## Fix Trigger.dev scheduled SMS job status updates (May 21, 2025)

### Issue
When scheduling SMS messages through Trigger.dev, the job was successfully sending the message via Twilio, but failed to update the status to 'completed' in the database with an error: `operator does not exist: text = uuid`.

### Root Cause
1. The `smsJobId` in the task payload was being passed as a string, but the database function `update_sms_job_status_completed` was trying to compare it directly with a `uuid` column without type casting.
2. The PostgreSQL error `operator does not exist: text = uuid` indicates that PostgreSQL cannot directly compare a text value with a UUID type without explicit casting.

### Solution Implemented
1. **Added UUID Validation**: Created a `validateUUID` helper function to verify the format and sanitize the UUID string before passing it to database operations.
2. **Multi-layered Approach**: 
   - First attempt: Use the RPC function with validated UUID
   - Fallback: Direct table update if the RPC function fails
3. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added try/catch blocks around each database operation with appropriate fallbacks.
4. **Improved Logging**: Added detailed logging of the smsJobId value and type at critical points in the process.

### Lessons Learned
- **Type Safety**: PostgreSQL requires explicit type casting when comparing UUID and text values (e.g., `WHERE id = input_text::uuid`).
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Having multiple approaches to update critical data improves system reliability.
- **Input Validation**: Validate inputs before sending to database operations, especially when type constraints are involved.
- **Detailed Logging**: Log both the value and type of critical fields to quickly diagnose type-related issues.
- **Direct Updates**: Sometimes a direct table update is more reliable than RPC functions for critical operations.


## Fix Trigger.dev scheduled SMS job status updates (May 20, 2025)
- PostgreSQL requires explicit type casting when comparing UUID and text
- Redundant update methods provide better reliability for critical operations
- Detailed logging at key points helps diagnose complex type-related issues

- Direct table updates can be more reliable than RPC functions in some cases

## Fix column names in scheduled SMS job status updates (May 20, 2025)
- Always verify table schema column names when creating database functions
- Use information_schema.columns to check actual column names
- Ensure both RPC functions and direct updates use consistent column names
- JSONB fields should be updated with proper structure for complex data

## Implement multiple fallback methods for SMS job status updates (May 20, 2025)
- Supabase .match() method handles UUID comparisons better than .eq()
- PostgreSQL functions with explicit type casting provide reliable database operations
- Multi-layered fallback approaches increase system reliability
- Direct SQL operations can bypass ORM-level type mismatches
- Error handling should consider multiple alternative paths to achieve critical updates

## Fix Database Trigger for Scheduled SMS Job Completion (May 20, 2025)

### Issue
While our previous fixes addressed the UUID/text comparison issue in the direct update calls, scheduled SMS jobs were still failing with the error `operator does not exist: text = uuid` because of a database trigger that runs when a job is marked as 'completed'.

### Root Cause Analysis
1. A database trigger `insert_livechat_message_on_completed()` runs whenever a scheduled_sms_job is updated to 'completed' status
2. This trigger was comparing a JSONB text extraction (`metadata->>'scheduled_job_id'`) directly with a UUID (`NEW.id`)
3. PostgreSQL doesn't allow direct comparison between UUID and text types without explicit casting

### Solution
1. **Updated the database trigger**: Modified the trigger function to properly cast types
   ```sql
   -- Changed from
   WHERE metadata->>'scheduled_job_id' = NEW.id;
   
   -- To
   WHERE metadata->>'scheduled_job_id' = NEW.id::text;
   ```

2. **Fixed JSONB storage**: Explicitly cast UUID to text when storing in JSONB
   ```sql
   -- Changed from
   jsonb_build_object('scheduled_job_id', NEW.id, ...)
   
   -- To
   jsonb_build_object('scheduled_job_id', NEW.id::text, ...)
   ```

### Lessons Learned
- **Database triggers** can be hidden sources of errors in complex systems
- **Type consistency** is critical throughout the entire data flow, including triggers and stored procedures
- When storing UUIDs in JSONB fields, always cast them to text (`uuid::text`) for consistent retrieval
- When comparing values extracted from JSONB with typed columns, ensure the types match or add explicit casts
- Always check the entire data path, including triggers that might run automatically when testing fixes
- Use `pg_get_functiondef()` to inspect trigger functions when debugging database-level type issues

## Contact Selector Modal - No Contacts Found Issue

**Date**: Current Fix

**Problem**: ContactSelectorModal was showing "No contacts found" even though contacts existed in the database for the workspace.

**Root Cause**: Column name mismatch between the frontend code and database schema:
- Frontend code was querying for `first_name` and `last_name` columns
- Database schema actually uses `firstname` and `lastname` columns (no underscore)

**Solution**: 
- Fixed SQL query to use correct column names: `firstname`, `lastname`
- Updated ORDER BY clause to use `firstname`
- Fixed filtering and display logic to use correct column names

**Key Learning**: Always verify database schema column names match the frontend queries. Small naming differences (like underscores) can cause complete data fetch failures.

**How to Debug**: 
1. Check database schema using MCP tools or direct SQL queries
2. Verify data exists in the correct workspace 
3. Compare frontend column names with actual database columns
4. Test query in database console first before implementing in code

**Files Changed**: 
- `frontend/src/components/flow-builder/sequences/ContactSelectorModal.js`

## Fixed: React Hooks Rules Violation in SequenceMetrics.js - January 2025

### Problem
Compilation error: `React Hook "useColorModeValue" is called conditionally. React Hooks must be called in the exact same order in every component render (react-hooks/rules-of-hooks)`

The error occurred because `useColorModeValue` was being called inside the JSX return statement (line ~300) rather than at the top level of the component.

### Root Cause
1. **Improper function structure**: The main `SequenceMetrics` component had become corrupted with:
   - Duplicate/misplaced code segments 
   - `return` statements outside of functions
   - Hook calls inside JSX instead of component top-level
   - Functions defined outside the main component

2. **Specific issue**: A `useColorModeValue('gray.300', 'gray.500')` call was placed inside the `_hover` prop of a `Select` component, violating the Rules of Hooks.

### How Fixed
1. **Reorganized component structure**: 
   - Moved all hook calls to the top of the component
   - Removed duplicate/corrupted code segments
   - Ensured proper function boundaries
   - Moved helper functions inside the main component

2. **Specific fix for useColorModeValue**:
   ```javascript
   // Added to top of component with other hooks
   const hoverBorderColor = useColorModeValue('gray.300', 'gray.500');
   
   // Updated JSX to use the variable instead of calling hook
   _hover={{
     borderColor: hoverBorderColor  // Instead of useColorModeValue('gray.300', 'gray.500')
   }}
   ```

### Lessons Learned
1. **React Rules of Hooks are strict**: All hooks must be called at the top level, before any conditional logic or returns
2. **Component structure matters**: Corrupted function boundaries can cause multiple syntax errors
3. **Systematic debugging approach**: Fix structure issues first, then address specific rule violations
4. **Prevention**: Always define color values and other hook results as variables at component top, then reference them in JSX

### How to Avoid
- Always call all hooks at the top of components before any conditional logic
- Never call hooks inside JSX expressions, event handlers, or nested functions
- Use ESLint rules for React hooks to catch these issues early
- Define reusable values from hooks as variables, then reference variables in JSX

## Fix pipeline stage creation and deletion data sync issue - Fixed refreshData function being blocked by isLoadingRef check during CRUD operations - Added invalidateCache function to explicitly clear stale cache data - Implemented force refresh parameter to bypass loading checks for create/update/delete (June 10, 2025)

# Pipeline Stage Creation/Deletion Data Sync Issue (June 10, 2025)

## Issue Identified
- Pipeline stage creation/deletion operations were showing success toasts but not immediately updating the UI
- Users had to refresh multiple times to see new stages appear or deleted stages disappear
- The `refreshData` function was being blocked by `isLoadingRef.current` checks during CRUD operations
- Cache invalidation was not happening properly for stage and metrics data

## Root Cause Analysis
- The `refreshData` function had a guard clause that prevented it from running if `isLoadingRef.current` was true
- During initial page load, this loading flag remained true, blocking subsequent refresh attempts triggered by create/delete operations
- Cache was not being explicitly cleared before refresh attempts, leading to stale data being displayed
- No differentiation between initial loading states and operation-triggered refreshes

## Implementation
- **Added `invalidateCache` function**: Explicitly clears stage and metrics cache before refresh operations
- **Implemented force refresh parameter**: `refreshData(force = true)` bypasses loading checks for CRUD operations  
- **Enhanced cache invalidation**: Clear both stages and metrics cache using proper cache keys based on pipeline ID
- **Improved error handling**: Better logging and error management for refresh operations
- **Loading state differentiation**: Separate handling for initial loads vs operation-triggered refreshes

## Key Code Changes
```javascript
// Before - blocked by loading check
const refreshData = useCallback(async () => {
  if (!isLoadingRef.current) { // This blocked CRUD refreshes
    // refresh logic
  }
}, []);

// After - force refresh for CRUD operations
const refreshData = useCallback(async (force = false) => {
  if (!force && isLoadingRef.current) return; // Skip only if not forced
  invalidateCache(); // Clear cache first
  // refresh logic with proper loading state management
}, []);
```

## Lessons Learned
- **Cache invalidation must happen before refresh attempts** to prevent stale data display
- **CRUD operations need immediate force refresh** to bypass concurrent loading checks  
- **Explicit cache clearing is more reliable** than relying on automatic expiration
- **Loading state management should differentiate** between initial loads and operation-triggered refreshes
- **Data synchronization issues often stem from cache management** rather than API problems
- **Force parameters in refresh functions** provide escape hatches for critical operations
- **Proper logging during cache operations** helps identify data sync issues quickly

## How it was fixed
1. Added `invalidateCache()` function to explicitly clear pipeline cache data
2. Modified `refreshData()` to accept a `force` parameter that bypasses loading checks
3. Updated all CRUD operations (create/update/delete) to call `refreshData(true)`
4. Enhanced logging to track cache invalidation and refresh operations
5. Improved error handling to catch and log refresh failures

## How it should not be done
- Don't rely on automatic cache expiration for immediate UI updates after CRUD operations
- Don't use global loading flags to block all refresh operations indiscriminately
- Don't assume cache will be automatically cleared when data changes on the server
- Don't implement refresh logic without force/bypass mechanisms for critical operations

## Fix contact selection limitation and remove pipeline toasts - Fixed opportunity form to load ALL workspace contacts instead of limited pagination - Removed all toast notifications from pipeline operations for cleaner UX - Fixed compilation errors by removing toast dependencies (June 10, 2025)

# Contact Selection Limitation and Toast Removal (June 10, 2025)

## Issues Identified
- Opportunity creation form only showed limited contacts (20) instead of all workspace contacts
- Contact selection dropdown was using paginated results which limited available options
- Pipeline operations showed too many toast notifications creating UI noise
- Toast dependencies remained in code causing compilation errors

## Root Cause Analysis
- `OpportunityForm.jsx` was calling `loadContacts()` with default pagination limit of 20
- The contact store was designed for display lists with pagination, not selection dropdowns
- Pipeline operations included multiple toast notifications for every create/update/delete action
- Removed toast import but missed cleaning up toast references in callback dependencies

## Solution Implemented
- **Contact Loading Fix**: Modified opportunity form to load all contacts with limit of 10,000
- **Async Loading**: Added proper loading state management for contact loading
- **Toast Removal**: Removed all toast notifications from pipeline operations (create, update, delete, reorder)
- **Clean Logging**: Replaced toasts with appropriate logger.info/logger.error statements
- **Dependency Cleanup**: Removed all toast dependencies and imports from usePipeline hook

## Code Changes
- `OpportunityForm.jsx`: Changed `loadContacts()` to `loadContacts(null, 10000)` with async/await
- `usePipeline.js`: Removed all toast notifications and useToast import
- Replaced toast success messages with `logger.info()`
- Kept error throwing behavior for proper error handling upstream

## How to Avoid
- **For Selection Dropdowns**: Always load complete datasets, not paginated results
- **Pagination vs Selection**: Use pagination for display lists, full loading for selection components
- **Toast Strategy**: Use toasts sparingly for critical user feedback only
- **Dependency Management**: When removing features, check all callback dependencies for cleanup

## Testing Notes
- Test contact selection dropdown shows all workspace contacts
- Verify pipeline operations work without toast notifications
- Check no compilation errors after removing toast dependencies
- Ensure error handling still works properly without toasts

### Trigger.dev Deployment Fixes

#### ✅ SUCCESSFUL FIX: Supabase Client Initialization Error (Jan 6, 2025)
**Issue:** Trigger.dev deployment failed with "supabaseKey is required" error during indexing phase
- Files affected: `trigger/unifiedWorkflows.js`, `trigger/unifiedContactTasks.js` 
- Error occurred when Supabase client was initialized at module level

**Root Cause:** 
- Trigger.dev's indexing phase runs without access to environment variables
- Module-level database client initialization causes deployment failures
- Environment variables like `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are not available during task registration

**Solution Applied:**
1. **Moved Supabase client creation** from module level into each task's `run` function
2. **Updated helper functions** to receive `supabaseAdmin` as a parameter 
3. **Fixed import paths** in `unifiedWorkflowRoutes.js` to avoid circular dependencies

**Code Pattern - WRONG:**
```javascript
// ❌ Module level - fails during indexing
const supabaseAdmin = createClient(
  process.env.SUPABASE_URL,
  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
);

export const myTask = task({
  id: "my-task",
  run: async (payload) => {
    // Uses module-level client
    await supabaseAdmin.from('table').select()
  }
});
```

**Code Pattern - CORRECT:**
```javascript
// ✅ Task level - works correctly
export const myTask = task({
  id: "my-task", 
  run: async (payload) => {
    // Initialize inside task
    const supabaseAdmin = createClient(
      process.env.SUPABASE_URL,
      process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY,
      {
        auth: {
          autoRefreshToken: false,
          persistSession: false
        }
      }
    );
    
    await supabaseAdmin.from('table').select()
  }
});
```

**Results:**
- ✅ Deployment successful: Version 20250706.4 
- ✅ 27 tasks detected and registered
- ✅ All unified workflow tasks working properly

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Never initialize external service clients at module level** in Trigger.dev tasks
- **Always create database/API clients inside task run functions** 
- **Environment variables are only available during task execution, not indexing**
- **Pass service clients as parameters** to helper functions when needed
- **Test deployment early** when adding new external service integrations

**How to Avoid Next Time:**
1. Always initialize clients inside `task.run()` functions
2. Check for module-level dependencies when adding new external services
3. Use this pattern for any service requiring environment variables (Twilio, SendGrid, etc.)
4. Test deployment after adding new tasks with external dependencies

## ✅ Fix Trigger.dev deployment - move Supabase initialization inside tasks (July 6, 2025)
- Trigger.dev indexing phase doesn't have access to environment variables
- Module-level database client initialization causes deployment failures
- All external service clients should be initialized inside task run functions

## Enhanced Unified Workflow SMS Integration with Board Phone Number Pattern (July 6, 2025)
- Board phone number pattern eliminates need for complex phone number selection logic
- Contact metadata contains the definitive source for outgoing SMS phone numbers
- Database schema consistency between API and workflow implementations is critical
- Test mode detection requires checking nested payload structures for proper bypassing

## Fix React Hook violations in frontend (July 6, 2025)
- React hooks must always be called in the same order on every render
- Never call hooks conditionally or after early returns in components
- Declare all hook values at component top level, then use variables in conditional logic

# Fix React leftIcon prop warning and remove unused AI functionality (January 2025)

## Issue Identified
- React warning: "React does not recognize the `leftIcon` prop on a DOM element"
- Unused AI functionality making unnecessary API calls to `https://cc.automate8.com/api/ai/features/15213`
- Tab component incorrectly using `leftIcon` prop which only works on Button components

## Root Cause
- Chakra UI's `Tab` component does not accept `leftIcon` prop - this is specific to `Button` components
- When `leftIcon` is passed to `Tab`, it gets passed to the underlying DOM element causing React warnings
- AI-related code was still imported and executing even after removing the AI Logs tab

## Technical Fix
1. **Fixed Tab leftIcon issue**: Replaced `leftIcon={<Zap size={14} />}` with `<HStack spacing={2}><Zap size={14} /><Text>AI Logs</Text></HStack>`
2. **Removed entire AI Logs tab**: Simplified interface by removing unused Tabs, TabList, TabPanels components
3. **Cleaned up AI imports**: Removed unused imports like `queueAIResponse`, `AIResponseLogsTab`, `Zap` icon
4. **Removed AI functionality**: Deleted `handleAIResponse` function and its usage in `handleIncomingMessage`

## Code Changes
- Removed Tab components entirely and used ChatArea directly
- Removed imports: `Tabs`, `TabList`, `Tab`, `TabPanels`, `TabPanel`, `HStack`, `Zap`, `AIResponseLogsTab`, `queueAIResponse`
- Deleted `handleAIResponse` function and removed AI response queueing from message handling
- Removed `activeTab` state and related tab management code

## Lessons Learned
- Always check component API documentation before using props (leftIcon only works on Button, not Tab)
- When removing features, ensure all related imports, functions, and API calls are also removed
- Unused code can continue making network requests and causing performance issues
- Clean up should include checking for indirect usage of removed functionality
- React warnings should be addressed immediately as they indicate improper prop usage

## How it should be done
- Use correct component APIs (leftIcon for Button, children for Tab content)
- Remove features completely including all imports, functions, and network calls
- Test that removed functionality no longer makes any API requests
- Use semantic HTML structure for Tab content instead of unsupported props

## How it should not be done
- Don't ignore React warnings about unrecognized props
- Don't leave unused imports and functions when removing features
- Don't assume component props work the same across different Chakra UI components
- Don't remove UI elements without cleaning up the underlying functionality

# Fix Supabase 406 errors from inefficient workspace member queries (January 2025)

## Issue Identified
- Multiple 406 "Not Acceptable" errors when clicking assignment buttons
- Queries like `user_profiles_with_workspace?select=id%2Cfull_name&id=eq.{user_id}` failing
- Assignment UI not loading properly due to failed user profile queries

## Root Cause Analysis
- `getWorkspaceMembers` function in `workspace.js` was making individual queries for each user by ID
- Queries were not filtering by workspace_id, causing 406 errors for users not in current workspace
- Some user IDs exist in multiple workspaces, others don't exist in the target workspace at all
- This approach was inefficient (N+1 queries) and error-prone

## Technical Fix
**Before** (problematic approach):
```javascript
const memberWithUserData = await Promise.all(
  members.map(async (member) => {
    const { data: userData, error: userError } = await supabase
      .from('user_profiles_with_workspace')
      .select('id, full_name')
      .eq('id', member.user_id)  // ❌ Individual query without workspace filter
      .single();
    // ...
  })
);
```

**After** (optimized approach):
```javascript
// Single query with workspace filter
const { data: profiles, error: profilesError } = await supabase
  .from('user_profiles_with_workspace')
  .select('id, full_name')
  .eq('workspace_id', workspaceId)  // ✅ Filter by workspace first
  .in('id', userIds);               // ✅ Then filter by user IDs
```

## Code Changes
- Modified `getWorkspaceMembers` function to use single batch query instead of individual queries
- Added workspace_id filter to ensure only relevant users are fetched
- Implemented user profile mapping for efficient data lookup
- Reduced query count from N queries to 1 query

## Performance Benefits
- Reduced database queries from N individual calls to 1 batch call
- Eliminated 406 errors by proper workspace filtering
- Faster assignment UI loading
- Better error handling and user experience

## Database Verification
Verified that workspace 15213 has 14 valid members:
- Users like `kartik` and `thenorbertsowul` exist in multiple workspaces
- Individual ID queries without workspace filter cause 406 errors
- Workspace-filtered batch queries work correctly

## Lessons Learned
- Always filter by workspace_id when querying workspace-related data
- Use batch queries with `in()` instead of individual queries in loops
- 406 errors often indicate missing or incorrect query filters
- Performance optimization and error reduction go hand-in-hand
- Test queries against actual data to identify edge cases

## How it should be done
- Filter by workspace context first, then by specific criteria
- Use batch queries for multiple related records
- Include proper error handling for missing data
- Verify queries work with actual database content

## How it should not be done
- Don't make individual queries for each record in a loop
- Don't query user data without workspace context
- Don't ignore 406 or other HTTP errors - they indicate real problems
- Don't assume user IDs exist in all workspaces

- Consistent branding improves user recognition and professional appearance

## Fix TypeScript JSX compilation error (July 15, 2025)
- TypeScript strict mode requires proper JSX element typing for react-icons
- Using Icon wrapper component ensures proper type checking
- All icon imports from react-icons should be wrapped when used as JSX elements

## Fix TypeScript JSX compilation errors by using direct icon approach (July 15, 2025)
- Direct icon usage with explicit props works better than Icon wrapper for react-icons
- TypeScript strict mode has trouble with IconType in Chakra UI Icon wrapper
- Always test build after making TypeScript-related changes

## Fix React import error by upgrading to React 19 (July 16, 2025)
- The 'use' function was introduced in React 19, not available in React 18
- React 19 includes enhanced concurrent features and improved performance
- Upgrading to React 19 requires updating both react and react-dom packages

## Fix Livechat Shortcut Dropdown Display and Message Sending (July 17, 2025)
- React Hooks must be called unconditionally at the top level of components

## Fix webhook board assignment system (July 18, 2025)
- Always verify which database tables are actually being used in production vs development
- Webhook automation systems need to match the UI configuration exactly
- Database schema mismatches can cause silent failures in automation rules

## Fix call functionality and add backend API endpoints (July 18, 2025)
- Always check database schema before assuming column existence in tables
- Backend API endpoints must be deployed before frontend can consume them
- Import paths matter - ensure components use correct context providers vs hooks

## Lessons Learned

## Call Logs Showing "client:user" Instead of Contact Names - FIXED

### Problem Description
The Action Center was displaying "client:user" instead of actual contact names for calls. This issue had multiple layers:

1. **Backend Data Issue**: Call logs were storing "client:user" as `from_number` for browser-initiated calls
2. **Missing Contact Associations**: Call logs weren't being associated with contact records via `contact_id`
3. **Frontend Display Logic**: The UI wasn't handling "client:user" entries gracefully
4. **Phone Number Format Mismatches**: Different phone number formats prevented proper contact lookup

### Root Causes
1. **Twilio Browser Client**: When users make calls from the browser, Twilio sends "client:user" as the `From` field
2. **No Contact ID Mapping**: Backend endpoints weren't looking up and setting `contact_id` when creating call logs
3. **Phone Number Variations**: Contacts might be stored with different formats (+1, without +1, etc.)
4. **Inbound Call Data Format**: For some inbound calls, the external caller number was in the `to_number` field instead of `from_number`

### Complete Solution

#### 1. Backend Call Logging Fixes

**File: `backend/inbound-outbound-calling/server.js`**
- ✅ Replace "client:user" with actual workspace phone number in call logs
- ✅ Add intelligent contact lookup and set `contact_id` during call log creation
- ✅ Handle multiple phone number formats for contact matching
- ✅ Smart logic to determine external caller number for both inbound and outbound calls

**File: `backend/inbound-outbound-calling/call-status-endpoint.js`**
- ✅ Fix "client:user" replacement in call status updates
- ✅ Add workspace number lookup for proper phone number substitution

**File: `backend/inbound-outbound-calling/make-direct-call.js`**
- ✅ Ensure `contact_id` is properly set when making direct calls

**File: `backend/inbound-outbound-calling/direct-call-endpoint.js`**
- ✅ Add contact lookup and set `contact_id` for direct call endpoint

#### 2. Database Fixes
- ✅ Updated existing call logs: replaced "client:user" entries with correct workspace phone numbers
- ✅ Associated existing call logs with proper contacts via `contact_id`

#### 3. Frontend Display Enhancements

**File: `frontend/src/components/action-center/sections/CallsSection.js`**
- ✅ Enhanced contact lookup with multiple phone number format variants
- ✅ Prioritized `contact_id` lookup over phone number matching
- ✅ Added fallback display "Web Client User" for any remaining "client:user" entries
- ✅ Added computer icon (💻) for web client calls

#### 4. Phone Number Format Handling
**Multiple variants tried for contact lookup:**
```javascript
const phoneVariants = [
  phoneNumber,                              // Original format
  phoneNumber?.replace(/[^\d+]/g, ''),     // Remove all non-digits except +
  phoneNumber?.replace(/^\+1/, ''),        // Remove +1 prefix
  phoneNumber?.replace(/^\+/, ''),         // Remove + prefix  
  `+1${phoneNumber?.replace(/[^\d]/g, '')}`, // Add +1 prefix to digits only
  `+${phoneNumber?.replace(/[^\d]/g, '')}`   // Add + prefix to digits only
];
```

### Key Technical Insights

1. **Twilio Webhook Data Variations**: The format of `From` and `To` fields can vary based on call flow and routing
2. **Contact ID Priority**: Always prefer `contact_id` foreign key lookup over phone number string matching
3. **Phone Number Normalization**: Critical to handle multiple phone number formats for reliable contact matching
4. **Client vs Server Calls**: Browser-initiated calls require special handling since Twilio identifies them as "client:user"

### Prevention Strategy

1. **Always Set Contact ID**: Ensure all call logging endpoints lookup and set `contact_id` when creating logs
2. **Robust Phone Matching**: Use multiple format variants when matching phone numbers to contacts
3. **Graceful Fallbacks**: UI should always have fallback display for edge cases
4. **Consistent Logging**: Standardize how different call types (browser, direct, webhook) are logged

### Testing Approach

1. **Database Verification**: Check call logs have proper `contact_id` associations
2. **UI Testing**: Verify Action Center shows contact names instead of phone numbers
3. **Multiple Call Types**: Test browser calls, direct calls, inbound calls, outbound calls
4. **Phone Format Edge Cases**: Test with various phone number formats

### Success Metrics
- ✅ 0 call logs with "client:user" as `from_number`
- ✅ All calls properly associated with contacts via `contact_id`
- ✅ Action Center displays contact names instead of phone numbers
- ✅ Fallback "Web Client User" shown for any edge cases

This fix resolved the user experience issue and ensures all future calls will be properly associated with contacts and display meaningful names in the UI.

## feat: Implement comprehensive Contact Timeline with memory-safe patterns (July 31, 2025)


## Phone Number Uniqueness Implementation (2024-01-15)

### ✅ What Worked Well
- **Application-level enforcement before database constraints**: Implementing uniqueness checks in `createOrUpdateContact` utility function first, then applying database constraints later proved to be the right approach
- **Shared utility functions across all platforms**: Creating identical `createOrUpdateContact` functions in frontend (`frontend/src/utils/contactUtils.js`), backend (`backend/src/utils/contactUtils.js`), and workers (`cloudflare-workers/*/src/utils/contactUtils.*`) ensured consistent behavior
- **Phone number normalization**: Using E.164 format (+15551234567) as the standard prevented format variations from creating duplicates
- **Flexible update strategies**: Allowing different behaviors for different use cases (manual creation shows warnings, webhooks auto-update) made the system practical
- **Comprehensive testing suite**: Creating multiple test scripts (Node.js, curl, real endpoints) provided thorough validation

### 🔧 Technical Implementation Details
- **Duplicate check query**: `SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE phone_number = ? AND workspace_id = ?` runs before every contact creation
- **Update vs Create logic**: Based on `allowUpdate` and `updateFields` options in the utility function
- **Error handling**: Proper response objects with `success`, `isNew`, `contact`, and `message` fields for consistent API responses
- **Database constraint handling**: Graceful handling of potential race conditions when database constraint is eventually applied

### 📋 Process Lessons
- **Start with existing data analysis**: Understanding that 10,292 duplicate phone numbers existed helped inform the approach
- **Foreign key constraints matter**: The extensive foreign key relationships (35+ tables) made direct duplicate cleanup complex, reinforcing the application-level approach
- **Test early and often**: Creating test scripts alongside implementation caught edge cases early
- **Documentation importance**: Comprehensive documentation (`docs/PHONE_NUMBER_UNIQUENESS_IMPLEMENTATION.md`) helped track the complex implementation across multiple systems

### ❌ What to Avoid
- **Don't apply database constraints to dirty data**: Attempting to add UNIQUE constraints without cleaning existing duplicates caused migration failures
- **Don't assume simple deletion**: Foreign key constraints prevented straightforward duplicate removal, requiring more sophisticated merging strategies
- **Avoid single-point-of-failure approaches**: Having duplicate prevention only in one layer (e.g., just database) wouldn't have handled the existing data situation
- **Don't ignore phone number format variations**: `(555) 123-4567` vs `+15551234567` vs `5551234567` all need to be treated as the same number

### 🛠️ Useful Patterns
- **Progressive enhancement**: Application-level enforcement now, database constraint later
- **Shared utility approach**: One function, multiple implementations for different environments
- **Flexible configuration**: Options object pattern for different update behaviors
- **Comprehensive error responses**: Structured response objects for consistent error handling
- **Test-driven validation**: Multiple testing approaches (unit, integration, manual) for confidence

### 🔍 Debugging Techniques That Helped
- **Direct database queries**: Using Supabase MCP to inspect actual constraint violations
- **Variable scope tracking**: ESLint error for `normalizedPhone` undefined showed importance of proper variable scoping in try/catch blocks
- **Progressive testing**: Starting with simple scenarios and building up to complex ones
- **Multiple test formats**: Node.js scripts, curl commands, and real endpoint tests provided different perspectives

### 📈 Success Metrics Established
- **Duplicate detection rate**: 100% of duplicate phones should be detected
- **Phone normalization accuracy**: All format variations should normalize correctly  
- **Update success rate**: Existing contacts should be updated, not duplicated
- **Response time**: < 500ms for webhook processing
- **Data integrity**: No orphaned or corrupted contact records

### 🎯 Future Improvements
- **Database cleanup strategy**: Develop business rules for merging duplicate contacts safely
- **Performance optimization**: Add database indexes for phone number lookups
- **Monitoring and alerting**: Set up production monitoring for duplicate prevention effectiveness
- **Extended phone format support**: Add support for more international phone number formats as needed

## Status Change Activity History Display Fix (September 14, 2025)

**Problem**: Activity history showing "From: Unknown → To: Unknown" for status changes

**Root Cause**: 
- The `ContactActivitiesService.getStatusHistory()` method was not enriching activity data with `old_status_name` and `new_status_name` from the metadata
- The status names were stored in `activity.metadata.old_status_name` and `activity.metadata.new_status_name` but not being extracted
- The `EnhancedActivityHistory` component was expecting `activity.old_status_name` and `activity.new_status_name` directly

**Solution**: 
Added data enrichment in `ContactActivitiesService.getStatusHistory()`:
```javascript
// Process the data and enrich with status names
const processedData = data?.map(activity => ({
  ...activity,
  // Enrich with status names from metadata
  old_status_name: activity.metadata?.old_status_name || 'Unknown',
  new_status_name: activity.metadata?.new_status_name || 'Unknown',
  created_by: activity.created_by_user_id 
    ? { id: activity.created_by_user_id, full_name: 'Team Member' }
    : { id: null, full_name: 'System' }
})) || [];
```

**How NOT to do it**:
- Don't modify the component display logic to dig into metadata - fix the data service layer
- Don't add database joins for UI display names - extract from existing metadata

**Key Lesson**: When activity history displays "Unknown" values, check if the data service is properly extracting metadata fields into the expected component prop structure.

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/services/ContactActivitiesService.js` (getStatusHistory method)

**Testing**: After the fix, status change activities should show proper "From: [Previous Status] → To: [New Status]" instead of "From: Unknown → To: Unknown"

## Pipeline Stage Creation Error Fix (September 14, 2025)

**Problem**: Error when creating pipeline stages: "Workspace ID, name, position, and pipeline ID are required" with `selectedPipelineId: null`

**Root Cause**: 
- Workspace `41608` had no pipelines configured
- The `PipelineView` component was trying to create stages without a valid pipeline ID
- When no pipelines exist, `selectedPipelineId` remains `null`, causing stage creation to fail

**Solution**: 
Modified `PipelineView.jsx` to automatically create a default pipeline when none exist:

```javascript
} else {
  console.warn('🔍 PIPELINE VIEW DEBUG - No pipelines found, creating default pipeline');
  
  // Auto-create a default pipeline when none exist
  try {
    const defaultPipeline = await pipelineService.createPipeline({
      name: 'Sales Pipeline',
      description: 'Default sales pipeline for managing opportunities'
    });
    
    console.log('🔍 PIPELINE VIEW DEBUG - Created default pipeline:', {
      pipelineId: defaultPipeline.id,
      pipelineName: defaultPipeline.name
    });
    
    setSelectedPipelineId(defaultPipeline.id);
  } catch (createError) {
    console.error('🔍 PIPELINE VIEW DEBUG - Error creating default pipeline:', createError);
    setSelectedPipelineId(null);
  }
}
```

**How NOT to do it**:
- Don't skip the auto-creation - users shouldn't see errors when trying to create their first stage
- Don't require users to manually create pipelines before using the pipeline view
- Don't leave `selectedPipelineId` as `null` when no pipelines exist

**Key Lesson**: When building pipeline/stage management systems, always ensure a default pipeline exists. Auto-create one if needed to prevent user confusion and errors.

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/opportunities/components/PipelineView.jsx` (initializePipeline function)

**Testing**: After the fix, users should be able to create stages immediately without getting pipeline ID errors. The system will automatically create a "Sales Pipeline" if none exist.

## Default Pipeline Creation on Workspace Setup (September 14, 2025)

**Problem**: New workspaces had no pipelines, causing errors when users tried to use pipeline features

**Root Cause**: 
- Workspace creation only set up basic workspace + membership + billing
- No default pipeline was created during workspace initialization
- Users encountered errors when trying to use pipeline features for the first time

**Solution**: 
Implemented automatic default pipeline creation during workspace setup:

1. **Created PipelineService** (`backend/src/services/pipelineService.js`):
```javascript
static async createDefaultPipeline(workspaceId, userId) {
  // Create default "Sales Pipeline" with is_default: true
  // Create 3 default stages: New, Pending, Done
}
```

2. **Modified workspace creation** (`backend/src/routes/workspace-members.js`):
```javascript
// Create default pipeline for the new workspace
let defaultPipeline = null;
try {
  const pipelineResult = await PipelineService.createDefaultPipeline(newWorkspace.id, user_id);
  defaultPipeline = pipelineResult;
} catch (pipelineError) {
  // Don't fail workspace creation if pipeline creation fails
}
```

3. **Updated response** to include pipeline creation status in workspace creation API

4. **Kept frontend fallback** in `PipelineView.jsx` as safety net for older workspaces

**How NOT to do it**:
- Don't rely solely on frontend pipeline creation - do it at workspace creation time
- Don't fail workspace creation if pipeline creation fails - it should be additive
- Don't forget to mark one pipeline as `is_default: true` for proper selection

**Key Lesson**: Infrastructure setup (pipelines, default data) should happen during resource creation (workspace setup), not during first feature usage. This prevents user confusion and errors.

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/src/services/pipelineService.js` (new file)
- `backend/src/routes/workspace-members.js` (workspace creation endpoint)
- `frontend/src/components/opportunities/components/PipelineView.jsx` (updated fallback comments)

**Testing**: New workspaces will automatically have a "Sales Pipeline" with 3 stages (New, Pending, Done). Existing workspace 41608 now has a default pipeline and the stage creation error is resolved.

## Lead Creation Validation Error Fix (September 14, 2025)

**Problem**: Lead creation failing with validation errors for null values in Cloudflare Workers API

**Error Messages**:
```
"Validation failed": [
  {"code":"invalid_type","expected":"number","received":"null","path":["estimated_value"]},
  {"code":"invalid_type","expected":"string","received":"null","path":["utm_source"]},
  {"code":"invalid_type","expected":"array","received":"null","path":["tags"]}
]
```

**Root Cause**: 
- Frontend `LeadCreator.js` was explicitly sending `null` values for optional fields
- Cloudflare Workers `createLeadSchema` used `.optional()` but didn't handle explicit `null` values
- Zod validation expected either the correct type or the field to be omitted entirely

**Solution**: 
Updated the Zod validation schema to handle nullable values properly:

```javascript
const createLeadSchema = z.object({
  // Changed from z.number().optional() to:
  estimated_value: z.number().nullable().optional(),
  
  // Changed from z.string().optional() to:
  utm_source: z.string().nullable().optional(),
  utm_medium: z.string().nullable().optional(),
  utm_campaign: z.string().nullable().optional(),
  initial_inquiry: z.string().nullable().optional(),
  
  // Changed from z.array(z.string()).default([]) to:
  tags: z.array(z.string()).nullable().transform(val => val || []).default([]),
  
  // Added nullable transforms for objects/arrays:
  pain_points: z.array(z.string()).nullable().transform(val => val || []).default([]),
  custom_fields: z.record(z.any()).nullable().transform(val => val || {}).default({})
});
```

**How NOT to do it**:
- Don't use only `.optional()` for fields that might receive explicit `null` values
- Don't change frontend logic to omit fields - the API should be flexible
- Don't ignore validation errors - they often reveal schema mismatches

**Key Lesson**: When designing APIs that accept JSON from frontends, always consider that JavaScript sends `null` explicitly. Use `.nullable().optional()` and `.transform()` to handle both `null` and `undefined` values gracefully.

**Files Modified**:
- `cloudflare-workers/leads-api/src/index.js` (createLeadSchema validation)

**Testing**: 
- ✅ Lead creation now works with null values  
- ✅ Created test lead: `1fd2bab1-00df-4ef5-a2dd-c9d2de06e207`

## Centralized Pipeline Management System (September 14, 2025)

**Problem**: Need to auto-create default lead pipeline stages for new workspaces and provide a centralized UI for pipeline management

**Requirements**:
1. Auto-create default lead pipeline stages when workspace is created
2. Create centralized pipeline management UI in `frontend/src/components/tools`
3. Allow users to modify pipeline stages in one location

**Solution**: 
Implemented comprehensive pipeline management system with both backend automation and frontend UI:

### **Backend Implementation**:

1. **Enhanced PipelineService** (`backend/src/services/pipelineService.js`):
```javascript
static async createDefaultLeadPipelineStages(workspaceId, userId) {
  // Creates 6 default stages: New, Qualified, Proposal, Won, Lost, Inactive
  // Each with proper colors, conversion probabilities, and ordering
}
```

2. **Updated Workspace Creation** (`backend/src/routes/workspace-members.js`):
```javascript
// Auto-creates both opportunity pipelines AND lead pipeline stages
const leadStagesResult = await PipelineService.createDefaultLeadPipelineStages(newWorkspace.id, user_id);
```

3. **Response Enhancement**: Workspace creation API now returns both pipeline and lead stage creation status

### **Frontend Implementation**:

1. **Main Component** (`frontend/src/components/tools/PipelineManagement.js`):
   - Centralized hub for all pipeline management
   - Tabbed interface: Lead Pipeline + Opportunity Pipeline
   - Workspace-aware with proper error handling

2. **Lead Pipeline Manager** (`frontend/src/components/tools/pipeline/LeadPipelineManager.js`):
   - Full CRUD operations for lead pipeline stages
   - Sortable table with stage order, colors, probabilities
   - Toggle active/inactive stages
   - Delete protection for default stages
   - Integration with Cloudflare Workers API v3

3. **Stage Form Modal** (`frontend/src/components/tools/pipeline/LeadStageFormModal.js`):
   - Complete form with validation
   - Color picker (react-colorful)
   - Auto-generated slugs from stage names
   - Conversion probability settings
   - Default stage management
   - Duplicate prevention

4. **Opportunity Pipeline Manager** (`frontend/src/components/tools/pipeline/OpportunityPipelineManager.js`):
   - Reuses existing opportunity pipeline components
   - Provides unified access to pipeline management modal
   - Links to opportunity dashboard

### **Default Lead Pipeline Stages Created**:
1. **New** (default, 10% probability, gray)
2. **Qualified** (30% probability, blue)  
3. **Proposal** (60% probability, amber)
4. **Won** (100% probability, green)
5. **Lost** (0% probability, red)
6. **Inactive** (0% probability, gray)

**Key Features**:
- 🔄 **Auto-Creation**: New workspaces get both opportunity pipelines AND lead stages
- 🎨 **Visual Management**: Color-coded stages with conversion probabilities
- 📊 **Order Control**: Drag-and-drop stage ordering (via order field)
- 🔒 **Protection**: Default stages can't be deleted
- ⚡ **Real-time**: Immediate updates via Cloudflare Workers API
- 🎯 **Centralized**: Single location in Tools for all pipeline management

**How NOT to do it**:
- Don't create separate UIs for different pipeline types - centralize them
- Don't forget to auto-create lead stages when creating opportunity pipelines
- Don't allow deletion of default stages without warnings
- Don't skip validation for stage slugs and ordering

**Key Lesson**: Complex feature management (pipelines) should have both automatic setup AND comprehensive management UI. Users need the system to "just work" initially but also need full control later.

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `backend/src/services/pipelineService.js` (enhanced with lead stages)
- `backend/src/routes/workspace-members.js` (auto-creation)
- `frontend/src/components/tools/PipelineManagement.js` (new)
- `frontend/src/components/tools/pipeline/LeadPipelineManager.js` (new)
- `frontend/src/components/tools/pipeline/LeadStageFormModal.js` (new)
- `frontend/src/components/tools/pipeline/OpportunityPipelineManager.js` (new)
- `frontend/src/components/tools/index.js` (new)

**Testing**: 
- ✅ Auto-creation works for new workspaces
- ✅ UI components integrate with API v3 endpoints
- ✅ Workspace 41608 has proper lead pipeline stages
- ✅ Color picker and form validation working
- ✅ CRUD operations functional via Workers API
