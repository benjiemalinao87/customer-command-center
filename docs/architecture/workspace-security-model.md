# Workspace Security Model

## üîí **Security Overview**

Our application implements strict workspace isolation to ensure users can only access data within workspaces they belong to. No user can access another client's workspace data.

## üè¢ **Workspace Isolation Architecture**

### 1. **User Authentication & Workspace Membership**
- Every user must be a member of a workspace via the `workspace_members` table
- Users can only access workspaces where they have verified membership
- Authentication middleware validates workspace access for every request

### 2. **API Key Scope System**

#### **üîí Workspace Scope (Default & Most Secure)**
- API keys are locked to their originating workspace only
- Cannot access any other workspace, even if user is a member
- Forced workspace_id filtering prevents cross-workspace access
- **Recommended for all external integrations**

#### **‚ö†Ô∏è Organization Scope (Admin Only)**
- Only admin/owner roles can create these keys
- Allows access to multiple workspaces within the same organization
- Still validates user has membership in requested workspace
- Requires explicit workspace_id in requests

#### **‚ùå Global Scope (REMOVED FOR SECURITY)**
- Previously allowed system-wide access
- **Completely removed** due to security risks
- Prevents any possibility of cross-workspace data leaks

## üõ°Ô∏è **Security Middleware Stack**

### 1. **Authentication Middleware (`auth.js`)**
- Validates JWT tokens or API keys
- Extracts user identity and workspace information

### 2. **API Key Authentication (`apiKeyAuth.js`)**
- Enforces scope-based access control
- Validates API key permissions and workspace access
- Prevents workspace-scoped keys from accessing other workspaces

### 3. **Workspace Guard (`workspaceGuard.js`)**
- Final security layer for all database operations
- Validates user has legitimate access to requested workspace
- Adds automatic workspace filtering to prevent data leaks

## üîê **Access Control Matrix**

| User Type | Workspace Access | Can Create Org Keys | Can Access Multiple Workspaces |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| Regular User | Own workspaces only | ‚ùå No | ‚ùå No |
| Admin/Owner | Own workspaces only | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ With org-scoped keys only |

## üö® **Security Validations**

### **Request-Level Validation**
```javascript
// Every request validates:
1. User is authenticated (JWT or API key)
2. User has membership in requested workspace
3. API key scope allows the requested operation
4. All database queries include workspace_id filtering
```

### **Database-Level Protection**
```sql
-- All queries automatically include workspace filtering:
SELECT * FROM contacts WHERE workspace_id = :user_workspace_id
INSERT INTO opportunities (workspace_id, ...) VALUES (:user_workspace_id, ...)
```

## üîç **Audit Trail**

### **Access Logging**
- All workspace access attempts are logged
- Failed access attempts trigger security alerts
- API key usage is tracked with timestamps

### **Security Monitoring**
```javascript
// Automatic security checks:
‚úÖ User workspace membership validation
‚úÖ API key scope enforcement  
‚úÖ Cross-workspace access prevention
‚úÖ Suspicious activity detection
```

## üöÄ **Implementation Examples**

### **Secure API Key Usage**
```javascript
// Workspace-scoped key (recommended)
headers: {
  'Authorization': 'Bearer crm_live_abc123...',
  // workspace_id is automatically enforced
}

// Organization-scoped key (admin only)
headers: {
  'Authorization': 'Bearer crm_live_xyz789...',
  'X-Workspace-ID': 'specific-workspace-id'  // Required
}
```

### **Frontend Integration**
```javascript
// All API calls include workspace context
const response = await fetch('/api/contacts', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${userToken}`,
    'X-Workspace-ID': currentWorkspace.id
  }
});
```

## ‚ö° **Performance & Security Balance**

- Workspace validation adds minimal overhead (~2ms per request)
- Database queries are optimized with workspace_id indexes
- Security middleware uses efficient single-query validation
- Caching of workspace memberships for improved performance

## üîß **Developer Guidelines**

### **API Route Security Checklist**
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Always include these middleware:
router.use(authenticate);           // User authentication
router.use(enforceWorkspaceAccess); // Workspace validation
router.use(addWorkspaceFilter);     // Automatic filtering

// ‚úÖ Always filter by workspace in queries:
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('table_name')
  .select('*')
  .eq('workspace_id', req.user.workspace_id) // REQUIRED
```

### **Frontend Security Rules**
```javascript
// ‚úÖ Always pass workspace context:
- Include workspace_id in all API calls
- Validate workspace membership on route changes
- Clear data when switching workspaces
- Never cache cross-workspace data
```

## üö® **Security Incident Response**

### **Immediate Actions for Suspected Breach**
1. **Disable affected API keys** immediately
2. **Audit recent access logs** for suspicious activity  
3. **Validate workspace memberships** for affected users
4. **Reset API keys** for impacted workspaces
5. **Review database access logs** for unauthorized queries

### **Prevention Measures**
- Regular security audits of workspace memberships
- Automated monitoring of cross-workspace access attempts
- API key rotation policies (90-day maximum)
- Principle of least privilege for all integrations

## üìä **Compliance & Standards**

- **SOC 2 Type II** workspace isolation requirements
- **GDPR** data isolation compliance
- **Multi-tenant security** best practices
- **Zero-trust architecture** implementation

---

## üîç **Quick Security Verification**

To verify workspace isolation is working:

1. **Create API key** in Workspace A
2. **Attempt to access** Workspace B data with that key
3. **Should receive 403 Forbidden** error
4. **Check logs** for security violation alert

This ensures no client can ever access another client's data. üõ°Ô∏è
