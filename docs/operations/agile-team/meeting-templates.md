# Meeting Templates (Scripts + Agendas)

## First team meeting (60–75 minutes)

### Purpose

Align on roles, cadence, and how you will turn internal-client knowledge into user stories that ship weekly.

### Who attends

- Benjie (CTO/Tech Lead)
- Frontend engineer (TBA)
- Backend intern (if available)
- Internal client / PO
- QA (if available)

### Agenda (copy/paste)

1. **Vision + why now (10m)**  
   “We’re building a CRM + texting/calling platform for home renovation operators. We’ll win by shipping weekly and learning from real workflows.”

2. **Roles + decision rules (10m)**  
   - PO owns what/why and accepts work  
   - Benjie owns architecture/quality and unblocks  
   - Team owns execution details

3. **Operating model (15m)**  
   Review: 1-week sprints, DoR/DoD, weekly demo.

4. **User stories system (20m)**  
   - Walk through a user story template  
   - Write 2 stories together live (one small, one too big → split)

5. **Seed the backlog (10–15m)**  
   Pick 10–20 initial stories and tag 3–5 as “Sprint 1 candidates”.

### Output checklist

- [ ] Cadence and ceremonies scheduled
- [ ] DoR/DoD agreed
- [ ] Backlog tool chosen
- [ ] At least 10 stories written with acceptance criteria

## Sprint Planning (45 minutes, Monday)

### Agenda

- **Sprint goal (5m)**: one sentence.
- **Pick stories (25m)**: smallest set that hits the goal.
- **Confirm weekly commitment (5m)**:
  - Default commitment: **8 small stories/week (≤ 1 dev-day each)**
  - Capacity buffer: **20–30% reserved** for review/support/QA/bugs
- **Clarify + split (10m)**: anything > 1–2 days gets split.
- **Commit (5m)**: confirm “what Done looks like.”

### Outputs

- Sprint goal
- Sprint backlog (stories + owners)
- Known risks and dependencies

### Bug handling reminder (quick)

- **P0/P1**: fix immediately (unlimited)
- **P2/P3**: backlog (competes with stories)

## Backlog Refinement (30 minutes, Wednesday)

### Purpose

Make next week’s stories “Ready” (DoR) so planning stays fast.

### Agenda

- Review top 5 upcoming stories
- Add acceptance criteria
- Identify missing info/dependencies
- Split oversized stories

## Demo / Sprint Review (30 minutes, Friday)

### Rules

- Demo only **Done** work (acceptance criteria met).
- Internal client/PO explicitly **accepts or rejects**.

### Agenda

- 1–2 minute sprint recap (goal + what shipped)
- Demo each story (2–5 minutes each)
- PO acceptance decisions
- Capture feedback as new stories

## Retro (30 minutes, Friday)

### Format: Start / Stop / Continue

- **Start**: one thing to try next week  
- **Stop**: one thing that created friction  
- **Continue**: one thing that worked well

### Retro rule

Pick **1–3 action items max**, assign an owner, and review next Friday.
