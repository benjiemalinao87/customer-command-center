# Lessons Learned: Multi-Day Campaign Sequence Builder Implementation

## Drag-and-Drop Without External Libraries (March 24, 2024)

### Native HTML5 Draggable API
- Implemented drag-and-drop using native browser APIs instead of external libraries
- Used just three event handlers: onDragStart, onDragOver, and onDragEnd
- Achieved simple yet effective reordering without adding library dependencies
- Maintained visual cues during drag operations for better UX

### State Management During Drag Operations
- Maintained clear draggedStep state to track the item being moved
- Used functional state updates to ensure proper step reordering
- Reset step_order properties after reordering to maintain sequence
- Prevented unnecessary renders during drag operations

## Tabbed Interface for Complex Workflows

### Step-by-Step Progress
- Divided complex sequence builder into discrete, focused tabs
- Maintained state across tab changes for seamless experience
- Implemented validation per section before allowing progression
- Used Next/Previous buttons for clear navigation flow

### Contextual Button Actions
- Adapted primary button based on current tab (Next vs. Save/Update)
- Simplified user decision-making at each step
- Maintained consistent button placement for predictability
- Disabled Previous button on first tab to prevent confusion

## Flexible Data Structures

### Adaptable Step Configuration
- Designed step data structure to handle multiple channel types
- Implemented channel-specific validations and UI elements
- Used metadata field for extensibility without schema changes
- Maintained consistent IDs across frontend and database

### Wait Time Configuration
- Implemented both day-based waits and specific time settings
- Defaulted first step to same day (day 0) for immediate start
- Added clear wait time visualization in collapsed view
- Used appropriate input controls for different time settings

## Immediate Visual Feedback

### Real-Time UI Updates
- Implemented immediate audience count updates when changing filters
- Added character counting for SMS messages
- Provided clear visual distinction between channels
- Used color-coded badges for improved scanability

### Editing Experience
- Implemented expandable/collapsible steps for focused editing
- Maintained preview of message content when collapsed
- Added clear visual hierarchy in the sequence view
- Used subtle animations for state transitions

## Component Separation

### Focused Component Architecture
- Separated implementation into five focused components
- Each component handles a specific responsibility
- Maintained clear interface between components
- Used props effectively for communication between components

### Consistent Styling
- Applied consistent Mac OS design principles throughout
- Used purple color scheme matching the Campaign Manager
- Maintained proper spacing and component hierarchy
- Implemented responsive layout for all screen sizes
