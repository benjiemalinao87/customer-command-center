### Implemented Backend Proxy for Cross-Origin API Access

Today we implemented a backend proxy solution to fix CORS issues in the broadcast feature. The broadcast functionality was failing because the browser was blocking direct requests from our frontend to the queue service hosted on a different domain.

#### Technical Implementation:
1. Created a new Express route module `backend/src/routes/queueProxy.js` that:
   - Acts as a middleman between frontend and queue service
   - Defines routes that mirror the queue service API (/schedule-sms, /schedule-email)
   - Forwards requests to the queue service and returns responses
   - Adds comprehensive error handling and logging

2. Registered the proxy routes in the main backend Express app:
   - Added `import queueProxyRoutes from './src/routes/queueProxy.js'`
   - Mounted routes at `/api/proxy/queue/*` with `app.use('/api/proxy/queue', queueProxyRoutes)`
   - Ensured CORS was properly configured for access from frontend

3. Updated frontend service to use proxy routes:
   - Modified `broadcastQueueService.js` to send requests to our backend proxy
   - Ensured payload formats matched the queue service expectations
   - Added fallback to direct SMS sending for redundancy
   - Enhanced error handling with detailed logging and toast notifications

4. Fixed DB functions and payload formatting:
   - Updated `get_broadcast_recipients_v1` to return `firstname` and `lastname`
   - Fixed message structure and payload format mismatches

This implementation provides a secure, maintainable solution that avoids CORS issues while adding several benefits like improved error handling, better logging, and fallback mechanisms. It follows our best practice of keeping external API calls within our own backend services rather than exposing them directly to the frontend.
