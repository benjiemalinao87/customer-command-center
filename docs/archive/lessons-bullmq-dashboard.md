# BullMQ Dashboard Integration and Queue Naming (March 19, 2024)

## Issue
1. Scheduled jobs were not appearing in the BullMQ dashboard monitoring interface
2. SMS messages weren't being reliably delivered when scheduled
3. There was no dedicated queue for SMS messages in the dashboard

## Root Cause
1. Queue names require specific formatting to appear in the dashboard
2. BullMQ queue names cannot contain colon characters
3. The dashboard was monitoring specific named queues that didn't match our dynamic naming pattern
4. SMS messages needed their own dedicated queue for proper monitoring and processing

## Solution
1. Queue Naming Conventions:
   - Changed workspace-specific queue format from `message-queue:${workspaceId}` to `message_queue_${workspaceId}`
   - Created standardized queue names like `SMSQueue` for dashboard visibility
   - Ensured consistent queue naming between producers and consumers

2. Dedicated SMS Worker:
   - Created a dedicated worker service for SMS processing
   - Implemented proper error handling and detailed logging
   - Connected the worker to the same Redis instance as the queue
   - Used explicit environment variable setting to prevent configuration issues

3. Dashboard Integration:
   - Created test scripts to add jobs to dashboard-visible queues
   - Verified jobs appear in the dashboard with proper state information
   - Ensured delayed jobs were properly processed at the scheduled time

4. Testing Approach:
   - Developed comprehensive testing scripts for both immediate and delayed messages
   - Added diagnostic reporting to verify job state and queue conditions
   - Used proper logging to track the full job lifecycle

## Key Learnings
1. BullMQ queue names cannot contain colon characters (`:`)
2. Workers require special Redis connection options (`maxRetriesPerRequest: null`)
3. The Bull Dashboard monitors specific named queues, not necessarily all queues in Redis
4. Use standardized queue names for easier monitoring and debugging
5. Set environment variables explicitly before importing modules with side effects
6. Test both job creation and job processing to ensure proper queue operation
7. Implement detailed logging for tracking job lifecycle and troubleshooting
8. Use dedicated workers for specific job types for better separation of concerns

## Future Improvements
1. Create a unified queue naming strategy that works with the dashboard
2. Implement a custom queue monitoring and management UI
3. Add support for retry strategies and dead letter queues
4. Enhance logging and visibility for scheduled messages
5. Create a centralized queue configuration setup for all queue types
6. Implement queue health monitoring and alerts
7. Add queue metrics collection for performance analysis
