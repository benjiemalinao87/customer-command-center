## Template 5: Re-engagement (No Response)

**Subject:** Last follow-up: 40% recurring commissions for communication platform

Hi [Partner Name],

I sent a couple emails about the CustomerConnects partnership opportunity, but haven't heard back. I understand you're probably busy!

**This will be my last follow-up**, but I wanted to share one quick update that might be relevant:

We just had a partner in [similar market] close their 25th customer, putting them in our 40% commission tier. That's **$2,000+ in monthly recurring commission** from this partnership alone.

**The math:** 25 customers × $200 average × 40% = $2,000/month = $24,000 annually

**If timing isn't right now, no worries at all.** But if you're ever interested in exploring recurring revenue opportunities in the communication space, feel free to reach out.

**Quick Demo:** [Calendly link] (15 minutes)

## Template 7: Success Story/Case Study Follow-up

**Subject:** How [Partner Company] is earning $42K annually with CustomerConnects

Hi [Prospect Name],

I wanted to share a quick success story that might be relevant to your business.

**[Partner Company], a [type of business] in [location], joined our partner program 8 months ago.**

**Their results:**
- **22 customers** acquired in 8 months
- **$42,000 annual recurring commission** (35% tier)
- **95% customer satisfaction** rate
- **Zero customer churn** (all customers still active)

**What they told us:**
*"The Voice AI feature is what closes deals. When prospects hear their phone ring and an AI assistant answers professionally, they immediately see the value. We've never had a product that sells itself like this."*

**How they did it:**
1. **Target Market:** Home improvement contractors (5-50 employees)
2. **Value Proposition:** Replace 5+ tools with one unified platform
3. **Demo Process:** 15-minute demos focusing on Voice AI
4. **Avg Deal Size:** $180/month per customer
5. **Sales Cycle:** 30-45 days average

**Why I'm sharing this:** Your business seems similar to [Partner Company] - serving [similar market] with [similar service]. I think you could see similar results.

**Would you be interested in a 15-minute call** to see how [Partner Company] built this recurring revenue stream? I can show you their approach and the platform that's generating these results.

**Calendar:** [Calendly link]  
**Partnership Info:** [Link to detailed proposal]

No pressure at all - just thought you might find their approach interesting.

## Template 8: Urgency/Limited Availability

**Subject:** 2 partnership spots remaining in [Geographic Area]

Hi [Partner Name],

Quick update on the CustomerConnects partnership opportunity:

**We're down to our final 2 partnership spots in [Geographic Area].** We intentionally limit partnerships to 2-3 per region to ensure partner success and territory protection.

**Current status:**
- **[Competitor/Similar Company]** applied last week
- **2 spots remaining** in your territory
- **Applications close** when spots are filled

**Why the limitation?** 
We've learned that too many partners in one area leads to:
- Price competition and margin pressure
- Confusion in the market
- Reduced partner success rates

**Better to have 2-3 highly successful partners** earning $40K-120K annually than 10 partners struggling to find customers.

**If you're still interested**, I'd recommend we schedule a call this week:
- **Tuesday:** 2:00 PM or 4:00 PM
- **Wednesday:** 10:00 AM or 3:00 PM  
- **Thursday:** 9:00 AM or 1:00 PM

**Or use this link:** [Calendly URL]

**If timing isn't right,** no worries at all. We'll likely open additional spots in 6-12 months as we expand.

Thanks for considering the partnership opportunity!

[Your Name]  
Partnership Director

P.S. - The partner who joined last month just closed their 6th customer. They're already earning $1,000+ monthly in recurring commissions.
