# Board Contact Integration Update - February 26, 2025

## Changes Made

### Contact Creation and Board Assignment
- Separated contact creation and board assignment into two distinct operations
- Created a new `AddContactToBoardModal` component for adding existing contacts to boards
- Added "Add to Board" option in the contact list item menu
- Simplified the contact creation modal by removing board selection
- Improved validation and error handling during contact creation
- Ensured that contacts can be created successfully even if board assignment fails

### Database Schema Improvements
- Identified and addressed issues with foreign key constraints
- Implemented checks to verify column existence before attempting to add contacts to boards
- Enhanced error logging for database schema-related issues
- Improved error handling to maintain data consistency

### User Experience Enhancements
- Provided clear feedback for each operation (contact creation and board assignment)
- Designed workflows that allow users to complete tasks in multiple steps
- Maintained data consistency even when some operations fail

## Next Steps
1. Test the new workflow thoroughly
2. Consider adding a bulk operation to add multiple contacts to a board at once
3. Implement a view to see all contacts assigned to a specific board column
