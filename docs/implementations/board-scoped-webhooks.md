# Board-Scoped Webhooks Implementation

## Overview
This feature implements board-level isolation for webhooks, ensuring that webhooks created in one board/inbox are only visible and accessible within that specific board.

## Problem Solved
Previously, webhooks were workspace-scoped, meaning all webhooks created in any board within a workspace were visible across all boards in that workspace. This caused confusion and potential security issues where users could see webhooks they didn't create.

## Implementation Details

### Database Changes
1. **Added `board_id` column** to `webhooks` table
   - Type: `TEXT`
   - Foreign key constraint: `REFERENCES boards(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`
   - Indexed for performance: `idx_webhooks_board_id` and `idx_webhooks_workspace_board`

2. **Migration Strategy**
   - Existing webhooks were migrated to boards based on name matching
   - Webhooks without matching board names were assigned to the first board in their workspace
   - All existing webhooks now have proper board associations

### Code Changes

#### WebhookPanel Component (`/frontend/src/components/webhook/WebhookPanel.js`)
1. **Updated component signature** to accept `board` prop
2. **Modified webhook fetching** to filter by both `workspace_id` AND `board_id`
3. **Updated webhook creation** to include `board_id` when creating new webhooks
4. **Added dependency** on `board.id` in useEffect to refetch when board changes

#### ConfigureBoard Component (`/frontend/src/components/board/sections/ConfigureBoard.js`)
- Already properly passes `board` prop to `WebhookPanel` component
- No changes required

### Key Features
- **Board Isolation**: Webhooks are now scoped to individual boards/inboxes
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing webhooks were properly migrated
- **Performance**: Added database indexes for efficient querying
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity

## Usage
When users navigate to different boards and access the "Inbound Webhook" tab in ConfigureBoard:
1. They will only see webhooks created for that specific board
2. New webhooks created will be automatically associated with the current board
3. Webhooks from other boards in the same workspace will not be visible

## Database Schema
```sql
-- webhooks table structure (relevant columns)
CREATE TABLE webhooks (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  workspace_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  board_id TEXT REFERENCES boards(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, -- NEW COLUMN
  status VARCHAR DEFAULT 'active',
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now(),
  -- ... other columns
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_webhooks_board_id ON webhooks(board_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_webhooks_workspace_board ON webhooks(workspace_id, board_id);
```

## Migration Results
- All existing webhooks successfully migrated to appropriate boards
- Name-based matching worked for webhooks like "Speed to Lead", "Denver", "TEST", etc.
- No data loss during migration
- Zero webhooks remaining with NULL board_id

## Testing
To verify the implementation:
1. Navigate to different boards in the same workspace
2. Check the "Inbound Webhook" tab in each board's configuration
3. Confirm that each board shows only its own webhooks
4. Create a new webhook in one board and verify it doesn't appear in other boards

## Future Considerations
- Consider adding a "Move Webhook" feature to transfer webhooks between boards
- Add audit logging for webhook board assignments
- Implement webhook sharing across boards if needed in the future
