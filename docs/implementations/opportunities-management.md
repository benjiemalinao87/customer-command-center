# Opportunities Management Implementation

## 1. Overview

### Purpose & Scope
The Opportunities Management feature extends the CRM capabilities by adding sales pipeline tracking, opportunity management, and forecasting. It allows users to track potential deals from initial contact through qualification, proposal, negotiation, and closing stages. This feature integrates with existing contacts and appointments to provide a complete view of the sales process.

**Implementation Status: ✅ BACKEND & FRONTEND API INTEGRATION COMPLETE**
- ✅ Database schema and tables created (opportunities, opportunity_stages, opportunity_history)
- ✅ Backend API endpoints deployed to Railway (https://cc.automate8.com)
- ✅ Authentication and authorization implemented
- ✅ Frontend API integration complete with consistent data sources
- ✅ Opportunity details sidebar working with backend API
- ✅ Opportunities list working with backend API
- ⏳ Pipeline visualization (Kanban board) pending implementation
- ⏳ Full UI components and reporting dashboard pending

**Key Goals:**
- ✅ Track potential sales opportunities with detailed information (backend + frontend ready)
- ⏳ Visualize sales pipeline with customizable stages (API ready, frontend pending)
- ✅ Link opportunities to contacts and appointments (working via API)
- ✅ Enable accurate sales forecasting and reporting (metrics endpoints ready)
- ⏳ Support team collaboration on opportunities (frontend pending)

**Non-Goals:**
- Complex enterprise-level sales automation
- Replacing existing contact management functionality
- Implementing a full ERP system

### Stakeholders
- **Sales Teams:** Primary users who will manage opportunities daily
- **Sales Managers:** Need visibility into pipeline and forecasting
- **Business Owners:** Require reporting and business intelligence
- **Administrators:** Will configure the system and manage permissions
