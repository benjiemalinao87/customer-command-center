# SMS/MMS Functionality Enhancements (April 3, 2025)

## Overview

We've enhanced the SMS node in the Flow Builder to support both SMS and MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) messages. This allows users to include images alongside text in their automated messages, significantly expanding the communication capabilities of the platform.

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes

1. **Updated SMS Preview Endpoint**:
   - Modified `/backend/src/routes/preview.js` to properly handle media attachments
   - Fixed the `mediaUrl` parameter formatting for Twilio API compatibility
   - Changed from passing a string to passing an array: `messageOptions.mediaUrl = [mediaUrl]`
   - Added comprehensive logging for better debugging and monitoring
   - Enhanced error handling for media-related issues

```javascript
// Updated code in preview.js
// Prepare message options
const messageOptions = {
  body: message,
  to: formattedPhone,
  from: fromNumber,
};

// Add mediaUrl if provided
if (mediaUrl) {
  messageOptions.mediaUrl = [mediaUrl];
  console.log('Including media URL in SMS preview:', mediaUrl);
}

// Send message via Twilio
const twilioMessage = await client.messages.create(messageOptions);
```

### Frontend Changes

1. **Enhanced MessageNode Component**:
   - Updated `/frontend/src/components/flow-builder/nodes/MessageNode.js` to support image URLs
   - Added the ability to include media URLs in test messages
   - Implemented a modal for entering test phone numbers if not already provided
   - Added variable replacement for placeholders in SMS content
   - Improved error handling and user feedback through toast notifications

```javascript
// Updated code in MessageNode.js
const response = await axios.post('https://cc.automate8.com/api/preview/send-sms', {
  phoneNumber: testPhoneNumber,
  workspaceId: currentWorkspace.id,
  previewText: messageText,
  mediaUrl: imageUrl // Include the image URL if available
});
```

## Testing and Verification

- Successfully tested sending MMS messages with image attachments
- Verified that the message SID changes from "SM" to "MM" when an MMS is successfully processed
- Confirmed proper display of images in received messages on mobile devices
- Tested with various image URLs and formats to ensure compatibility

## Technical Considerations

1. **Twilio API Requirements**:
   - Twilio requires the `mediaUrl` parameter to be passed as an array, even for a single image
   - Messages can include up to 10 media files with a total size of up to 5MB
   - Twilio automatically resizes images as necessary for successful delivery

2. **Deployment Process**:
   - Backend changes required deployment to Railway through GitHub integration
   - Local development changes need to be pushed to GitHub to trigger deployment

## User Experience Benefits

- Enhanced communication capabilities with rich media content
- Improved engagement through visual messaging
- More effective marketing and informational messages
- Consistent experience across both SMS and MMS message types

## Next Steps

- Consider adding support for multiple images in a single message
- Implement a media library for commonly used images
- Add image preview functionality in the MessageNode component
- Explore additional media types supported by MMS (video, audio)
